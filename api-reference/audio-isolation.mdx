## Pricing

The API is charged at 1000 characters per minute of audio.

## Removing background noise with our Python SDK
Our Audio Isolation API is what powers our Voice Isolator, which removes background noise from audio and leaves you with crystal clear dialogue. To get started, here's an example you can follow using our [Python SDK.](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-python)

```python
from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs

# Initialize the client with your API key
client = ElevenLabs(api_key="your api key")

# Path to the audio file you want to isolate
audio_file_path = "sample_file.mp3"


with open(audio_file_path, "rb") as audio_file:
    # Perform audio isolation
    isolated_audio_iterator = client.audio_isolation.audio_isolation(audio=audio_file)

    # Save the isolated audio to a new file
    output_file_path = "cleaned_file.mp3"
    with open(output_file_path, "wb") as output_file:
        for chunk in isolated_audio_iterator:
            output_file.write(chunk)


print(f"Isolated audio saved to {output_file_path}")
```
