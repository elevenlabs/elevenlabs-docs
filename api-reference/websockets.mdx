This API provides real-time [text-to-speech](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) conversion using WebSockets. This allows you to send a text message and receive audio data back in real-time.

<Note>
Endpoint:<br/>`wss://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}/stream-input?model_id={model}`

# When to use

The Text-to-Speech Websockets API is designed to generate audio from partial text input while ensuring consistency throughout the generated audio. Although highly flexible, the Websockets API isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. It's well-suited for scenarios where:
* The input text is being streamed or generated in chunks.
* Word-to-audio alignment information is required.

For a practical demonstration in a real world application, refer to the [Example of voice streaming using ElevenLabs and OpenAI](#example-of-voice-streaming-using-elevenlabs-and-openai) section.

# When not to use

However, it may not be the best choice when:
* The entire input text is available upfront. Given that the generations are partial, some buffering is involved, which could potentially result in slightly higher latency compared to a standard HTTP request.
* You want to quickly experiment or prototype. Working with Websockets can be harder and more complex than using a standard HTTP API, which might slow down rapid development and testing.

In these cases, use the [Text to Speech API](/api-reference/text-to-speech) instead.

# Protocol

The WebSocket API uses a bidirectional protocol that encodes all messages as JSON objects.

# Streaming input text

The client can send messages with text input to the server. The messages can contain the following fields:
```json
{
  "text": "This is a sample text ",
  "voice_settings": {
    "stability": 0.8,
    "similarity_boost": 0.8
  },
  "generation_config": {
    "chunk_length_schedule": [120, 160, 250, 290]
  },
  "xi_api_key": "<XI API Key>",
  "authorization": "Bearer <Authorization Token>"
}

```

<ParamField body="text" type="string" required>
    Should always end with a single space string `" "`. In the first message, the text should be a space `" "`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="try_trigger_generation" type="boolean" default={false} required>
This is an advanced setting that most users shouldn't need to use. It relates to our generation schedule explained [here](#understanding-how-our-websockets-buffer-text).

Use this to attempt to immediately trigger the generation of audio, overriding the `chunk_length_schedule`. Unlike flush, `try_trigger_generation` will only generate audio if our [buffer](#understanding-how-our-websockets-buffer-text) contains more than a minimum threshold of characters, this is to ensure a higher quality response from our model. 
    
Note that overriding the chunk schedule to generate small amounts of text may result in lower quality audio, therefore, only use this parameter if you really need text to be processed immediately. We generally recommend keeping the default value of `false` and adjusting the `chunk_length_schedule` in the `generation_config` instead.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="voice_settings" type="object" >
  This property should only be provided in the first message you send.
  <Expandable title="properties">
      <ParamField body="stability" type="number" >
        Defines the stability for voice settings.
      </ParamField>

      <ParamField body="similarity_boost" type="number">
        Defines the similarity boost for voice settings.
      </ParamField>

      <ParamField body="style" type="number">
        Defines the style for voice settings. This parameter is available on V2+ models.
      </ParamField>

      <ParamField body="use_speaker_boost" type="boolean">
        Defines the use speaker boost for voice settings. This parameter is available on V2+ models.
      </ParamField>
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>

<a id="chunk_length_schedule"></a>
<ParamField body="generation_config" type="object">
   This property should only be provided in the first message you send.
  <Expandable title="properties" defaultOpen>

    <ParamField body="chunk_length_schedule" type="array">
        This is an advanced setting that most users shouldn't need to use. It relates to our generation schedule explained [here](#understanding-how-our-websockets-buffer-text).

        Determines the minimum amount of text that needs to be sent and present in our buffer before audio starts being generated. This is to maximise the amount of context available to the model to improve audio quality, whilst balancing latency of the returned audio chunks.

        The default value is: [120, 160, 250, 290].

        This means that the first chunk of audio will not be generated until you send text that totals at least 120 characters long. The next chunk of audio will only be generated once a further 160 characters have been sent. The third audio chunk will be generated after the next 250 characters. Then the fourth, and beyond, will be generated in sets of at least 290 characters.

        Customize this array to suit your needs. If you want to generate audio more frequently to optimise latency, you can reduce the values in the array. Note that setting the values too low may result in lower quality audio. Please test and adjust as needed.

        Each item should be in the range 50-500.
    </ParamField>

  </Expandable>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="flush" type="boolean">
    Flush forces the generation of audio. Set this value to `true` when you have finished sending text, but want to keep the websocket connection open.
    
    This is useful when you want to ensure that the last chunk of audio is generated even when the length of text sent is smaller than the value set in `chunk_length_schedule` (e.g. 120 or 50).

    To understand more about how our websockets buffer text before audio is generated, please refer to [this](#understanding-how-our-websockets-buffer-text) section.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="xi_api_key" type="string">
    Provide the XI API Key in the first message if it's not in the header.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="authorization" type="string">
    Authorization bearer token. Should be provided only in the first message if not present in the header and the XI API Key is not provided.
</ParamField>

<Note>
For best latency we recommend streaming word-by-word, this way we will start generating as soon as we reach the predefined number of un-generated characters.
</Note>

##  Close connection

In order to close the connection, the client should send an End of Sequence (EOS) message. The EOS message should always be an empty string:


```json End of Sequence (EOS) message
{
    "text": ""
}
```

<ParamField body="text" type="string" required>
    Should always be an empty string `""`.
</ParamField>



## Streaming output audio

The server will always respond with a message containing the following fields:

```json Response message
{
    "audio": "Y3VyaW91cyBtaW5kcyB0aGluayBhbGlrZSA6KQ==",
    "isFinal": false,
    "normalizedAlignment": {

# Understanding how our websockets buffer text

Our websocket service incorporates a buffer system designed to optimize the Time To First Byte (TTFB) while maintaining high-quality streaming.

All text sent to the websocket endpoint is added to this buffer and only when that buffer reaches a certain size is an audio generation attempted. This is because our model provides higher quality audio when the model has longer inputs, and can deduce more context about how the text should be delivered.

The buffer ensures smooth audio data delivery and is automatically emptied with a final audio generation either when the stream is closed, or upon sending a `flush` command. We have advanced settings for changing the chunk schedule, which can improve latency at the cost of quality by generating audio more frequently with smaller text inputs.
