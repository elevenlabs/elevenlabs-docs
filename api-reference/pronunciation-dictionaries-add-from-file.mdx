## Adding a pronunciation dictionary

Here is some example code for uploading a [pronunciation dictionary](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/projects/overview#pronunciation-dictionaries) and printing the response `pronunciation_dictionary_id` and `version_id`. You'll require these identifiers in the request body if you intend to use `pronunciation_dictionary_locators`.

All you will need to do is replace `API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key and `PATH_HERE` with the actual path to the PLS file you want to upload.

If you need help in understanding how to properly format a PLS / pronunciation dictionary, please refer to the guide [here](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/projects/overview#pronunciation-dictionaries).

<info>There is currently no way to fetch or update old dictionaries uploaded. Therefore, you will need to keep track of the identifiers. If you need to update the dictionary, you will have to upload a new one.</info>

```python
import requests
import os

# Define your API key and the base URL for the Eleven Labs API
XI_API_KEY = "API_KEY_HERE"
BASE_URL = "https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1"

# Setup the headers for HTTP requests to include the API key and accept JSON responses
headers = {
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "xi-api-key": XI_API_KEY
}

## Using a pronunciation dictionary

Here is some example code on how to use these identifiers or locators in your text-to-speech call.

```python
import requests

# Set your API key and base URL
XI_API_KEY = "API_KEY_HERE"
BASE_URL = "https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1"
VOICE_ID = "TxGEqnHWrfWFTfGW9XjX"

# Headers for the request
headers = {
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "xi-api-key": XI_API_KEY
}

def text_to_speech(text, pronunciation_dictionary_id, version_id):
    """
    Sends a text to speech request using a pronunciation dictionary.
    Returns:
    An audio file.
    """
    # Define the URL for the text-to-speech endpoint
    url = f"{BASE_URL}/text-to-speech/{VOICE_ID}"
    
    # Payload for the request
    payload = {
        "model_id": "eleven_monolingual_v1",
        "pronunciation_dictionary_locators": [
            {
                "pronunciation_dictionary_id": pronunciation_dictionary_id,
                "version_id": version_id
            }
        ],

    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    
    # Check the response status
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Here you can save the audio response to a file if needed
        print("Audio file generated successfully.")
        
        # Save the audio to a file
        with open("output_audio.mp3", "wb") as audio_file:
