<Tip>Follow our [Voice Design Prompt Guide](/voices/voice-lab/voice-design#voice-design-prompt-guide) for best results.</Tip>

When you hit generate, we'll create three voice previews. You will be charged credits equal to the length of the text you submit (you are charged this amount once per call, even though you receive three voice previews). "Text" should be no less than 100 characters and no more than 1k characters.
