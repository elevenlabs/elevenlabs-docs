# Creating dubs using our API

In order to create dubs using our API be sure to set ```mode="automatic"```, and upload your file to be dubbed using the ```file``` parameter. At this time automated dubbing doesn't support automatically dubbing from a ```csv_file```/```foreground_file```/```background_file```.
