# Dubbing Video and Audio with ElevenLabs API: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction
Dubbing videos and audio files from one language to another can be an essential requirement in content localization. The ElevenLabs API provides a convenient way to automatically dub media files using state-of-the-art technology. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of setting up a project that leverages ElevenLabs' capabilities to dub a file or a video from a URL.

If you're looking to jump straight into the action, the complete code is available on the following repos:

- [Python example repo](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-examples/dubbing/python).

FYI: The Dubbing API is currently exclusive to our enterprise clients; however, we anticipate a broader rollout in the near future.

## How to dub a video with ElevenLabs

### Requirements

Before proceeding, please ensure that you have the following:
- An ElevenLabs account with an API key (hereâ€™s how to [find your API key](/api-reference/text-to-speech#authentication)).
- Python installed on your machine

### Setting Up the Environment

Before you begin, make sure you have installed the necessary SDKs and libraries. You will need the ElevenLabs SDK for the text to speech conversion. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install elevenlabs
```

Additionally, install necessary packages to manage your environmental variables:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

Next, create a `.env` file in your project directory and fill it with your credentials like so:

```bash .env
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
```

### Start the dubbing

#### Dubbing a Local File
The script `create_a_dub_from_file.py` is responsible for dubbing an existing audio or video file. Here's how to use it:

1. Ensure that `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is loaded from your `.env` file.
2. Call the `create_dub_from_file` function, passing the necessary arguments:

```python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = create_dub_from_file(
        "../example_speech.mp3",  # Input file path
        "audio/mpeg",  # File format
        "en",  # Source language
        "es",  # Target language
    )
    if result:
        print("Dubbing was successful! File saved at:", result)
    else:
        print("Dubbing failed or timed out.")

```

### Check for completion

The `wait_for_dubbing_completion()` function within the `dubbing_utils.py` file continuously checks whether the dubbing process is complete. If completed, it proceeds to the next step; otherwise, it reports the status or failure.

```python

def wait_for_dubbing_completion(dubbing_id: str) -> bool:
    """
    Waits for the dubbing process to complete by periodically checking the status.

    Args:
        dubbing_id (str): The dubbing project id.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the dubbing is successful, False otherwise.
    """
    MAX_ATTEMPTS = 120
    CHECK_INTERVAL = 10  # In seconds

    for _ in range(MAX_ATTEMPTS):
        metadata = client.dubbing.get_dubbing_project_metadata(dubbing_id)
        if metadata.status == "dubbed":
            return True
        elif metadata.status == "dubbing":
            print(
                "Dubbing in progress... Will check status again in",
                CHECK_INTERVAL,
                "seconds.",
            )
            time.sleep(CHECK_INTERVAL)
        else:
            print("Dubbing failed:", metadata.error_message)
            return False

    print("Dubbing timed out")
    return False

```

### Save the video locally

Upon completion of dubbing, the `download_dubbed_file()` function in `dubbing_utils.py` will save the dubbed file to a local directory, typically under the `data/{dubbing_id}/{language_code}.mp4`.

```python

def download_dubbed_file(dubbing_id: str, language_code: str) -> str:
    """
    Downloads the dubbed file for a given dubbing ID and language code.

    Args:
        dubbing_id: The ID of the dubbing project.
        language_code: The language code for the dubbing.

    Returns:
        The file path to the downloaded dubbed file.
    """
    dir_path = f"data/{dubbing_id}"
    os.makedirs(dir_path, exist_ok=True)

    file_path = f"{dir_path}/{language_code}.mp4"
    with open(file_path, "wb") as file:
        for chunk in client.dubbing.get_dubbed_file(dubbing_id, language_code):
            file.write(chunk)

    return file_path

```

### Dubbing a YouTube video (or any video from a URL)

For dubbing web-based content, use the `create_a_dub_from_url.py` script. Pass the video URL, source language, and target language as arguments to the `create_dub_from_url` function. This script is similar to `create_a_dub_from_file` but designed for web content.

```python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    source_url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EqSXDwTq6U"  # Charlie bit my finger
    source_language = "en"
    target_language = "fr"
    result = create_dub_from_url(source_url, source_language, target_language)
    if result:
        print("Dubbing was successful! File saved at:", result)
    else:
        print("Dubbing failed or timed out.")

```

The system works with popular platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, and Vimeo. Ensure you pass the correct video URL.

## Conclusion

With this guide and the accompanying code structure, you now have a basic setup for dubbing audio and video content using the ElevenLabs API. Whether you're working with local files or content from URLs, you can create multilingual versions of your media to cater to diverse audiences.

Remember to always follow the best practices when dealing with API keys and sensitive data, and consult the ElevenLabs API documentation for more advanced features and options. Happy dubbing!
