This tutorial will guide you through the process of automatically dubbing audio and video files into multiple languages using ElevenLabs SDK. Whether you are looking to translate video content for global reach or create audio in different languages, the ElevenLabs API simplifies the entire process. This can be particularly beneficial for content creators looking to expand their audiences to regions that speak Hindi, Spanish, French, and many other languages supported by ElevenLabs.

If you're looking to jump straight into the action, the complete code is available on the following repos:

 - [Python example repo](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-examples/dubbing/python).

 - [Node/TypeScript example repo](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-examples/dubbing/node).

 FYI: The Dubbing API is currently exclusive to our enterprise clients; however, we anticipate a broader rollout in the near future.

## Requirements

Before proceeding, please ensure that you have the following:
- An ElevenLabs account with an API key (hereâ€™s how to [find your API key](/api-reference/text-to-speech#authentication)).
- Python(Node.js, TypeScript) installed on your machine

## Setup

### Installing our SDK

Before you begin, make sure you have installed the necessary SDKs and libraries. You will need the ElevenLabs SDK for the text to speech conversion. You can install it using pip:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Python
pip install elevenlabs
```

```bash TypeScript
npm install elevenlabs
```

</CodeGroup>

Additionally, install necessary packages to manage your environmental variables:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Python
pip install python-dotenv
```

```bash TypeScript
npm install dotenv
npm install @types/dotenv --save-dev
```

</CodeGroup>

Next, create a `.env` file in your project directory and fill it with your credentials like so:

```bash .env
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
```

## Create the Dubbing Function

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# create_a_dub.py

import os
import time
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs

load_dotenv()

ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = os.getenv("ELEVENLABS_API_KEY")
if ELEVENLABS_API_KEY is None:
    raise ValueError(
        "ELEVENLABS_API_KEY environment variable not found. "
        "Please copy the .env.example file to .env and fill in the API key."
    )

client = ElevenLabs(api_key=ELEVENLABS_API_KEY)

def create_dub_file(
    input_file_path, output_file_path, file_format, source_lang, target_language
):
    # Check file existence
    if not os.path.isfile(input_file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"The input file does not exist: {input_file_path}")

    input_file_name = os.path.basename(input_file_path)
    
    with open(input_file_path, "rb") as audio_file:
        response = client.dubbing.dub_a_video_or_an_audio_file(
            file=(input_file_name, audio_file, file_format),
            target_lang=target_language,
            mode="automatic",
            source_lang=source_lang,
            num_speakers=1,
            watermark=True,  # reduces the characters used
        )

    dubbing_id = response.dubbing_id

    MAX_ATTEMPTS = 120  # for example, if you want to wait for 20 minutes, set 120 (10s * 120 = 20 minutes)
    CHECK_INTERVAL = 10  # time in seconds to wait before checking the status again

    for attempt in range(MAX_ATTEMPTS):
        metadata = client.dubbing.get_dubbing_project_metadata(dubbing_id=dubbing_id)
        if metadata.status == "dubbed":
            response = client.dubbing.get_dubbed_file(
                dubbing_id=dubbing_id,
                language_code=target_language,
            )

            if response.status_code == 200:
                with open(output_file_path, "wb") as file:
                    file.write(response.content)
                print(f"Dubbing complete and saved to {output_file_path}.")
                return output_file_path
            else:
                print("Failed to get the dubbed file:", response.json())
                return None

        elif metadata.status == "dubbing":
            print("Dubbing in progress... Will check status again in", CHECK_INTERVAL, "seconds.")
            time.sleep(CHECK_INTERVAL)
        else:
            print("Dubbing failed:", metadata)
            return None

    print("Dubbing timed out")
    return None
```

```typescript TypeScript

```

</CodeGroup>

## Call the Dubbing Function

To execute dubbing:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# main.py

from create_dub import create_dub_file

# Main function to start dubbing process
def main():
    input_file = "input.mp3"    # Update with your input file name
    output_file = "output.mp4"  # Update with your desired output file name
    file_format = "audio/mpeg"  # Update with your file format
    source_language = "en"
    target_language = "es"      # Update with your target language

    create_dub_file(input_file, output_file, file_format, source_language, target_language)
    print("Dubbing process completed.")

# Entry point of the script
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```typescript TypeScript

```

</CodeGroup>

This command will process the input file and save the output to `output.mp4` or your defined output file name.

## Conclusion

You've now learned how to automate the dubbing of content using ElevenLabs SDK. By localizing audio and video into different languages, you can expand your reach and provide more inclusive content.
