## Example

Check out the [Projects API Python example](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-examples/tree/main/examples/text-to-speech/python/projects-api) to see how to use the Projects API to create voiceovers for long-form content.

## 1. Introduction

The Projects API is a powerful tool for creating voiceovers for long-form content such as articles, blog posts, or audiobooks. It allows you to generate audio from text, and then stitch together the audio clips to create a seamless narration. The API is designed to be easy to use, and provides a number of features to help you create high-quality voiceovers.

**Note: The Projects API is currently only available on our [enterprise](https://elevenlabs.io/enterprise) plan**.

Some of the other enterprise features include:

- **Projects API integration.** Integrate your CMS with ElevenLabs Projects API to automatically voice content as itâ€™s published.
- **High Quality Output.** Produce crystal clear voice content at the highest available quality level, compliant with audiobook distributor standards.
- **Unlimited AudioBooks and Articles.** Voice everything from the archive to the latest publications with unlimited Projects.

## 2. Working with the Projects API

### Prerequisites

- Finish the [Python Text-to-Speech Guide](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/python-text-to-speech-guide#introduction)

### Working with long form content

The Projects API is designed to work with long-form content such as articles, blog posts, or audiobooks. You can use the API to generate audio from text, and then stitch together the audio clips to create a seamless narration.

### Creating a Project via the API

Once you cloned the example above you can check out the `add-text.py`

```python
import requests
import os

# URL for the API endpoint
url = "https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/projects/add"

# Retrieve the API key from an environment variable
api_key = os.getenv('ELEVENLABS_API_KEY')

# Specific voice and model identifiers
voice_id = "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM"
model_id = "eleven_multilingual_v2"

headers = {
    'xi-api-key': api_key,  # Use the API key from the environment variable
}

# Text to save and the file name
text_content = "Hello this is an ElevenLabs PDF"
file_name = 'example.txt'

# Save the string to a text file
with open(file_name, 'w') as text_file:
    text_file.write(text_content)

# Open the text file in binary mode and prepare the multipart payload
with open(file_name, 'rb') as f:
    files = {
        'name': (None, 'Example Text File'),
        'from_document': (file_name, f, 'text/plain'),  # Changed to text/plain for a text file
        'default_title_voice_id': (None, voice_id),
        'default_paragraph_voice_id': (None, voice_id),  # Assuming same voice_id for paragraph
        'default_model_id': (None, model_id),
    }

    # Make the POST request
    response = requests.post(url, files=files, headers=headers)

    # Print the response text
    print(response.text)
```

#### Explanation

- The `url` variable contains the URL for the API endpoint.
- The `api_key` variable retrieves the API key from an environment variable. Set it with `export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_api_key`.
- The `voice_id` and `model_id` variables contain the specific voice and model identifiers. To get the voices use `curl -X GET https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/voices -H "xi-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"`. To get the models use `curl -X GET https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/models -H "xi-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"`.
- The `text_content` variable contains the text to save and the `file_name` variable contains the name of the file to save the text to.
- The `with open(file_name, 'w') as text_file:` block saves the string to a text file.
- The `with open(file_name, 'rb') as f:` block opens the text file in binary mode and prepares the multipart payload.
- The `files` dictionary contains the multipart payload.
- The `response = requests.post(url, files=files, headers=headers)` line makes the POST request to the API endpoint.
- The `print(response.text)` line prints the response text.

You can also extend this to multiple files by adding more files to the `files` dictionary.

### Text to speech API for PDFs and ePubs

To practice with PDFs and ePubs use the `add-pdf.py` and `add-epub.py` files respectively.

### Converting projects

If you successfully uploaded a project above, you will get a response that looks something like this:

```json
{
  "project": {
    "project_id": "2KBCWl7YAxvBX7HHp4F0",
    "name": "Example Text File",
    "create_date_unix": 1713901389,
    "default_title_voice_id": "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM",
    "default_paragraph_voice_id": "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM",
    "default_model_id": "eleven_multilingual_v2",
    "last_conversion_date_unix": null,
    "can_be_downloaded": false,
    "title": null,
    "author": null,
    "isbn_number": null,
    "volume_normalization": false,
    "state": "default"
  }
}
```

Note the `project_id` field. We will use it to convert the project to audio. To do that let's look at `convert-project.py`:

```python
import requests
import os

project_id = "project_id" # Fill in the response of `add-text.py`

# Retrieve the API key from an environment variable
api_key = os.getenv('ELEVENLABS_API_KEY')  # Use a default or leave it to raise an error if not set

headers = {
    'xi-api-key': api_key,  # Use the API key from the environment variable
}

url = f"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/projects/{project_id}/convert"

response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```

You should get the following response:

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

### Getting snapshots

Now that you have converted the project to audio, you can get snapshots of the audio. To do that let's look at `get-snapshots.py`:

```python
import requests
import os

# TODO remove project_id
project_id = "project_id" # Fill in the response of `add-text.py`

# Retrieve the API key from an environment variable
api_key = os.getenv('ELEVENLABS_API_KEY')

headers = {
    'xi-api-key': api_key,  # Use the API key from the environment variable
}

url = f"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/projects/{project_id}/snapshots"

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```

The response you get will look something like this:

```json
{
  "snapshots": [
    {
      "project_snapshot_id": "hK7DQndFVTuNGlyLMLXz",
      "project_id": "2KBCWl7YAxvBX7HHp4F0",
      "created_at_unix": 1713902627,
      "name": "Example Text File"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Streaming the audio

Now that you have the snapshots, you can stream the audio. To do that let's look at `stream-audio.py`:

```python


```

### Saying complex words using pronunciation dictionaries

{/* TODO add link to the example once it's merged */}

## Conclusion

The Projects API is a powerful tool for creating voiceovers for long-form content such as articles, blog posts, or audiobooks. It allows you to generate audio from text, and then stitch together the audio clips to create a seamless narration. The API is designed to be easy to use, and provides a number of features to help you create high-quality voiceovers available in multiple languages.

If they have feedback on this API or want us to look into adding more advanced features let us know. We are always looking to improve our APIs and make them more useful for our users.
