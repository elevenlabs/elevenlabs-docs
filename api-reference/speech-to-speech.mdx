## Audio generation

Generating speech-to-speech involves a similar process to text-to-speech, but with some adjustments in the API parameters. Instead of providing text when calling the API, you provide the path to an audio file that you would like to convert from one voice to another. Here’s a modified version of your code to illustrate how to generate speech-to-speech using the given API:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import requests  # Used for making HTTP requests
import json  # Used for working with JSON data

# Define constants for the script
CHUNK_SIZE = 1024  # Size of chunks to read/write at a time
XI_API_KEY = "<xi-api-key>"  # Your API key for authentication
VOICE_ID = "<voice-id>"  # ID of the voice model to use
AUDIO_FILE_PATH = "<path>"  # Path to the input audio file
OUTPUT_PATH = "output.mp3"  # Path to save the output audio file

# Construct the URL for the Speech-to-Speech API request
sts_url = f"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/speech-to-speech/{VOICE_ID}/stream"

# Set up headers for the API request, including the API key for authentication
headers = {
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "xi-api-key": XI_API_KEY
}

# Set up the data payload for the API request, including model ID and voice settings
# Note: voice settings are converted to a JSON string
data = {
    "model_id": "eleven_english_sts_v2",
    "voice_settings": json.dumps({
        "stability": 0.5,
        "similarity_boost": 0.8,
        "style": 0.0,
        "use_speaker_boost": True
    })
}

# Set up the files to send with the request, including the input audio file
files = {
    "audio": open(AUDIO_FILE_PATH, "rb")
}

# Make the POST request to the STS API with headers, data, and files, enabling streaming response
response = requests.post(sts_url, headers=headers, data=data, files=files, stream=True)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.ok:
    # Open the output file in write-binary mode
    with open(OUTPUT_PATH, "wb") as f:
        # Read the response in chunks and write to the file
        for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=CHUNK_SIZE):
            f.write(chunk)
    # Inform the user of success
    print("Audio stream saved successfully.")
else:
    # Print the error message if the request was not successful
    print(response.text)
```
