# Quick Start

### Authentication
In order to use our API you need to get your `xi-api-key` first.
[Create an account](https://elevenlabs.io/sign-up), log in
and in the upper right corner click on your profile picture -> profile.

<Frame caption="Visit profile">
  <img src="/images/visit-profile.png" />
</Frame>

Next click on the eye icon on your profile to access your `xi-api-key`.
Do not show your account to anyone else. If someone gains access to your `xi-api-key`
he can use your account as he could if he knew your password.

You can generate a new `xi-api-key` at any time by clicking on the spinning arrows
next to the text field. This will invalidate your old `xi-api-key`.


## Audio generation
Generate spoken audio from text with a simple request like the following python example:

```python
import requests

CHUNK_SIZE = 1024
url = "https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/<voice-id>"

headers = {
  "Accept": "audio/mpeg",
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "xi-api-key": "<xi-api-key>"
}

data = {
  "text": "Born and raised in the charming south, 
  I can add a touch of sweet southern hospitality 
  to your audiobooks and podcasts",
  "model_id": "eleven_monolingual_v1",
  "voice_settings": {
    "stability": 0.5,
    "similarity_boost": 0.5
  }
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
with open('output.mp3', 'wb') as f:
    for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=CHUNK_SIZE):
        if chunk:
            f.write(chunk)
```
