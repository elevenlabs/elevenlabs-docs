# Introduction
Our AI model produces the highest-quality AI voices in the industry. 

Our [text to speech](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) [API](https://elevenlabs.io/api) allows you to convert text into audio in 29 languages and 1000s of voices. Integrate our realistic text to speech voices into your react app, use our Python library or our websockets guide to get started.

# Quick Start

### Authentication
In order to use our API you need to get your `xi-api-key` first.
[Create an account](https://elevenlabs.io/sign-up), log in
and in the lower left corner click on your profile picture -> "Profile + API key".

<Frame caption="Visit profile">
  <img src="/api-reference/images/profile_picture.png" />
</Frame>

Next click on the eye icon on your profile to access your `xi-api-key`.
Do not show your account to anyone else. If someone gains access to your `xi-api-key`
he can use your account as he could if he knew your password.

You can generate a new `xi-api-key` at any time by clicking on the spinning arrows
next to the text field. This will invalidate your old `xi-api-key`.

## Audio generation
Generate spoken audio from text with a simple request like the following Python example:

```python
import requests

CHUNK_SIZE = 1024
url = "https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/<voice-id>"

headers = {
  "Accept": "audio/mpeg",
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "xi-api-key": "<xi-api-key>"
}

data = {
  "text": "Born and raised in the charming south, 
  I can add a touch of sweet southern hospitality 
  to your audiobooks and podcasts",
  "model_id": "eleven_monolingual_v1",
  "voice_settings": {
    "stability": 0.5,
    "similarity_boost": 0.5
  }
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
with open('output.mp3', 'wb') as f:
    for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=CHUNK_SIZE):
        if chunk:
            f.write(chunk)
```


## Voices
We offer 1000s of voices in 29 languages. Visit the [Voice Lab](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-lab) to explore our pre-made voices or [clone your own](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-cloning). Visit the [Voices Library](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library) to see voices generated by ElevenLabs users.

## Generation & Concurrency Limits
All our models support up to 10k characters (~10 minutes of audio) in a single request. To achieve consistency over long form audio, try [request stitching](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/how-to-use-request-stitching).

The concurrency limit (the maximum number of concurrent requests you can run in parallel) depends on the tier you are on.
- Free: 2
- Starter: 3
- Creator: 5
- Pro: 10
- Scale: 15

If you need a higher limit, reach out to our [Enterprise team](https://elevenlabs.io/enterprise) to discuss a custom plan.

## Supported languages
Our TTS API is multilingual and currently supports the following languages:

`Chinese, Korean, Dutch, Turkish, Swedish, Indonesian, Filipino, Japanese, Ukrainian, Greek, Czech, Finnish, Romanian, Russian, Danish, Bulgarian, Malay, Slovak, Croatian, Classic Arabic, Tamil, English, Polish, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Hindi and Portuguese`. 

To use them, simply provide the input text in the language of your choice.
