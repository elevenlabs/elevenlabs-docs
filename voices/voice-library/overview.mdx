The [Voice Library](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library) (VL) is a marketplace where our community can share voices and earn rewards when they're used. At the moment, only Professional Voice Clones (PVCs) can be shared in the library. Instant Voice Clones (IVCs) cannot be shared for safety reasons.

  <p>
    The lock icon on a voice card indicates that the voice has a Notice Period
    set. The Notice Period lets you now how long you'll continue to have access
    to the voice if the voice owner decides to remove it from the Voice Library.

<Card
  title="Character Multiplier"
  icon={<img src="/voices/voice-library/images/multiplier.png" />}
>
  You may see a blue character multiplier badge on some voices explaining that
  the voice 'costs' more in characters than a standard voice. This is normal and
  can happen when a voice owner sets a custom rate that is very high. Please pay
  close attention, as character multipliers mean your account will be deducted
  &gt;1x the number of characters you generate with a voice that has a character
  multiplier.
</Card>
<Card
  title="Live Moderation"
  icon={<img src="/voices/voice-library/images/moderation.png" />}
>
  Voices with 'Live Moderation' enabled have a pink 'M' badge in the top row of
  the voice card.
</Card>

## Filters, Sorting, and Search

To help you find the perfect voice for you, the Voice Library is searchable and filterable by:

- Category
  - Voice Design 
  - Professional
  - High-Quality
- Language
  - The Language of PVCs shared in the library is set during the voice creation process based on the audio samples uploaded by the voice owner
  - While all voices are compatible with our multilingual models and can therefore be used with all 29 languages we support, voices marked as a certain language should perform well for content in that language
- Other metadata set by voice owners when <a href="sharing">sharing voices in the Voice Library</a>
  - Accent (note that you must first select a language as accents are language-specific)
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Use case

You can also sort the list of results based on your interest by clicking the dropdown menu in the top right-hand corner of the Voice Library:

- Trending: voices are ranked by our trending algorithm
- Latest: newest voices shown first
- Most Users
- Most Characters Generated
