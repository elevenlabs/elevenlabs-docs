# ElevenLabs DX

This repo contains the source for the ElevenLabs documentation site, the [Next.js example app](./examples/elevenlabs-nextjs/) and the SDK generation.

The autogenerated content (docs and SDK) all live inside the `fern` folder.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the ElevenLabs documentation, but ask that you first read through the [style guide](./fern/docs/contributing-style-guide.md) before submitting pull requests.

## Running the docs

The [Fern CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fern-api) is what builds the documentation.

Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

Install the dependencies

```
pnpm install
```

Run the following command at the root of the folder

```
pnpm run dev
```

Run the following command to lint/format the project

```
pnpm run fmt
```

## Code Snippets

The documentation includes tested code snippets that demonstrate how to use ElevenLabs APIs and SDKs.

### Snippets Workflow

1. **Create Code Examples**:

   - Write language-specific examples in `examples/snippets/` directory
   - Organize by language: `examples/snippets/python/` and `examples/snippets/node/`
   - Use consistent naming across languages (e.g., `quickstart_tts.py` and `quickstart_tts.mts`)

2. **Test Snippets**:

   - Run `pnpm run snippets:test` to verify all snippets have valid syntax
   - Run `pnpm run snippets:typecheck` to check TypeScript types

3. **Generate Documentation Snippets**:

   - Run `pnpm run snippets:generate` to create MDX files with code blocks
   - The script combines examples from different languages into CodeBlocks components
   - Generated files are placed in `fern/snippets/generated/`

4. **Use in Documentation**:
   - Import the generated MDX files into documentation using the `<Markdown>` component:
   ```mdx
   <Markdown src="/snippets/generated/quickstart_tts.mdx" />
   ```

This workflow ensures that all code examples in the documentation have valid syntax and stay up-to-date.

## Organizing API Documentation

When you run `pnpm run openapi:update` to update the OpenAPI spec, new endpoints may appear at the bottom of the API reference instead of being organized into the appropriate sections. This is because the documentation organization is controlled by the `fern/docs.yml` file.

### How docs.yml Works

The `fern/docs.yml` file controls how API endpoints are organized and displayed in the documentation. It has two main sections:

1. **Product Guides** (`docs` tab): Contains user-facing documentation, tutorials, and guides
2. **API Reference** (`api-reference` tab): Contains the actual API endpoints organized from the OpenAPI spec

### Adding New Endpoints to Existing Sections

When new API endpoints are added to the OpenAPI spec, you need to manually organize them in `docs.yml`. There are two ways to reference endpoints:

1. **Endpoint Groups**: Reference entire groups of related endpoints using their OpenAPI tag name:

   ```yaml
   contents:
     - workspace
     - textToSpeech
     - speechToText
   ```

2. **Individual Endpoints**: Reference specific endpoints with custom organization:
   ```yaml
   contents:
     - section: Service Accounts
       contents:
         - endpoint: GET /v1/workspace/service-accounts
           title: Get Workspace Service Accounts
         - endpoint: POST /v1/workspace/service-accounts
           title: Create Service Account API Key
         - endpoint: DELETE /v1/workspace/service-accounts/{api_key_id}
           title: Delete Service Account API Key
   ```

### Example: Adding Service Accounts to Administration

To add new Service Accounts endpoints under the Administration section:

1. Locate the `ADMINISTRATION` section in the `api-reference` layout (around line 1027 in `docs.yml`)
2. Add the endpoints to the appropriate subsection:
   ```yaml
   - section: ADMINISTRATION
     skip-slug: true
     contents:
       - history
       - models
       - section: Studio
         # ... existing studio endpoints
       - section: Service Accounts # Add this new section
         contents:
           - endpoint: GET /v1/workspace/service-accounts
             title: Get Workspace Service Accounts
           - endpoint: POST /v1/workspace/service-accounts
             title: Create Service Account API Key
           # ... other service account endpoints
       - pronunciationDictionaries
       # ... rest of administration endpoints
   ```

### Best Practices

- **Group Related Endpoints**: Organize endpoints into logical sections (e.g., Service Accounts, Webhooks, Studio)
- **Use Descriptive Titles**: Provide clear, action-oriented titles for endpoints
- **Maintain Hierarchy**: Place new sections in logical positions within existing structures
- **Test Locally**: Run `pnpm run dev` to preview changes before committing

This organization ensures that new API endpoints appear in the correct sections of the documentation rather than being automatically placed at the bottom of the list.

## Other developer resources

### SDKs

We support the following SDKs which can be used to interact with the ElevenLabs platform:

- [Python](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-python)
- [Typescript](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js)

# SDK generation

While this public repo contains the source for generating ElevenLabs SDKs, only ElevenLabs employees can trigger a regeneration.

The SDK generation is based on two specs and a configuration file:

- [OpenAPI spec](./fern/apis/api/openapi.json)
- [AsyncAPI spec](./fern/apis/api/asyncapi.yml)
- [Generators config](./fern/apis/api/generators.yml)

## How to update the SDKs

1. Deploy the backend with the updated OpenAPI spec
2. Update openapi.json in this repo with the new OpenAPI spec (`pnpm run openapi:latest`)
3. (Optional but recommended) Run `fern check` to validate the API and `fern generate --group python-sdk --preview` to create the generated intermediate step locally
4. (Optional) Test the changes locally by running `fern generate --group python-sdk --preview` and inspecting the generated folder
5. Add in appropriate overrides to the `openapi-overrides.yml` doc, and repeat steps 3 and 4 until it's correct
6. Trigger the Python and Typescript Github Actions. To do this, go to the `Actions` tab and click `Release TypeScript SDK` or `Release Python SDK`. Enter in the appropriate version number e.g. `1.1.1` (bumped from what's currently released). This will create PRs into the elevenlabs-python or elevenlabs-js repos. **Note:** Only ElevenLabs employees can trigger these actions.
7. Review and merge the PRs into the elevenlabs-python or elevenlabs-js repos.
8. Create a release tag on both the Python and Typescript repos to release them.

## Validating your API Definition

To validate your API, run:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run fern:check
```

To view the changes locally run

```sh
fern generate --group python-sdk --preview
# `fern write-definition` shows you the intermediate step
```
