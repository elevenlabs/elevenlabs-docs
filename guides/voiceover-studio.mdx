Similar to the Dubbing Studio, the new **Voiceover Studio** offers users the chance to create interactive content with greater flexibility. It integrates the Studio functionality with the Sound Effects feature, allowing users to create dialogues for multiple speakers from scratch and seamlessly incorporate their own creative sound effects throughout the project.
