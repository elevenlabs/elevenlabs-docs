title: "Projects: Managing Long-Form Content"
---

**Projects** offer an end-to-end workflow for creating long-form content. You can upload a book, document, or import a webpage via URL. The AI generates a voiceover for the entire content, and you can download individual MP3 files for each chapter or a single file for the whole document or audiobook.

### Step by step on how to create a Project

1. **Create a New Project**
   - Go to the Projects in your Navigation Menu.
   - Click "Create New Project."
   - Enter the project name and description.
   - Choose to create an empty project or import a file (EPUB, PDF, TXT) or a webpage via URL.
   - Select the default voice and model, and set the quality settings.
   - Click "Create."

2. **Add and Manage Content**
   - Add files by uploading documents or importing text from a URL.
   - Organize your content into folders or chapters.
   - The system will auto-split well-structured files into chapters.

3. **Generate Voiceover**
   - Open your project and select the text to convert.
   - Choose a voice model and adjust settings (e.g., voice stability, style, similarity).
   - Click the play button to generate the voiceover for the selected text block.
   - For continuous play, use the "Continuous Play" button to listen to multiple paragraphs sequentially.

4. **Adjust Settings and Regenerate Audio**
   - Use the "Settings" button to adjust the project's default voice and view model settings.
   - In the "Block Settings" panel, change voice settings for specific blocks.
   - To regenerate a paragraph, select it and click the "Regenerate" button.

5. **Download Audio Files**
   - Once satisfied, download individual MP3 files for each paragraph or chapter.
   - Click the "Convert" button to compile and download the entire project or specific chapters as a single audio file.
   - Use the "Download" button for various download options, including project-wide or chapter-specific files.

6. **Pronunciation Dictionaries**
   - Upload a pronunciation dictionary in PLS (Pronunciation Lexicon Specification) format via project settings.
   - Use phonemes or aliases to specify accurate pronunciations of words, ensuring consistency and clarity in the generated speech.

**Exercise**: Upload [*Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11) and convert a chapter of your choosing using the voice of your choosing. Download said chapter.
