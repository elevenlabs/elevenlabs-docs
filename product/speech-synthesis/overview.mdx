Now that you have your voice, it's time to generate some voiceovers! Head over to [Text-to-Speech](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) and try out your voice - you can find your voices in the dropdown menu. You can preview all voices by pressing `►` next to the voice name. If you don't see the button, you need to make an initial generation for it to show up. Simply write some text in the text box and press generate. Amazing, isn't it?

However, there are a few things to keep in mind:

- The settings of the AI are nondeterministic, so each time you press generate, you will get slightly different results.
- If you click the drop-down for Voice Selection and start typing, you will automatically search through your list of voices.
- The [Voice Settings](/product/speech-synthesis/voice-settings) have a big influence on how the voice sounds and performs. Playing around with these settings will be necessary to find the best tone and performance for your project. A lot of users set them to fixed values that they know work for them, usually stability around 50 and similarity around 75, and then keep generating until they find a performance they like without changing the values much.
- We offer a number of models that you can choose from. Our Multilingual v2 and Turbo v2.5 offer multilingual support, while the Turbo v2 model supports English only. For more details, please see the [Models](/product/speech-synthesis/models) section of this guide.
- You can encourage the AI to deliver something in a specific way with a certain emotion depending on the text, context, and dialogue tag. For example, `"That's not funny", he said seriously.` This is not perfect but it is a workaround that a lot of people have found helpful while we wait for the next iteration.
- You can also use [Voice Changer](/api-reference/speech-to-speech) to combine the content and emotion of your uploaded audio with your newly created voice.
