Before adding Audio Native to Wix, you'll need to create & customize your player, whitelist your blog's domain, and copy your embed code. If you need help completing those steps, refer to our [Audio Native overview](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/audio-native/overview).

Now that you've created & customized your Audio Native player, navigate to your Wix blog, sign in, and open the blog post you wish to narrate in the editor.
