While the exact cause remains a mystery, this sudden split left many fans wondering if their friendship can ever be repaired.
The On-Again, Off-Again Saga: Justin Bieber and Shawn Mendes
Musicians Justin Bieber and Shawn Mendes have a friendship that's as dramatic as their music. They first met as teenagers on the singing competition show "The Next Star" and quickly became close friends.Their camaraderie translated into chart-topping collaborations until their
first public argument in 2019. Harsh words exchanged during an interview marked the beginning of a public feud.

I threw in a mix of frozen fruits, spinach, protein powder, and almond milk for my first smoothie test. The EkoBlend blended everything into a smooth and creamy consistency in under a minute. No

2. Beauty by Blair: The Flawless Filter Foundation – Does it Really Live Up to the Name?
Hey beauty babes! Blair here, ready to spill the tea on the new Flawless Filter Foundation by Lumina Cosmetics. This foundation has been all over social media, with influencers claiming it delivers flawless, filter-like skin. So, I put it to the test – is it all hype or a holy grail product?

Packaging:
The Flawless Filter Foundation comes in a luxurious glass bottle with a pump dispenser. The packaging feels weighty and high-quality, fitting for the price tag. The shade range is pretty decent, offering a good selection for various skin tones. I opted for shade 22 Light Beige, which matched my skin perfectly.
Formula and Coverage:
The foundation boasts a lightweight, buildable formula. It feels comfortable on the skin and doesn't cake up, even when layered for fuller coverage. The finish is a beautiful natural satin – not too matte, but not too dewy either. While it doesn't completely cover blemishes, it evens out skin tone and minimizes imperfections effectively. For those who need extra coverage, a concealer can be used for targeted areas.
Application:
This foundation applies beautifully with a variety of tools. I tried it with a damp beauty blender, a foundation brush, and even my fingers, and it blended seamlessly each time. It didn't settle into fine lines or wrinkles, which is a major plus for me.
Longevity:
The Flawless Filter Foundation claims to be long-lasting and transfer-proof. I wore it for a full workday, and it held up pretty well. There was minimal fading throughout the day, and it didn't transfer onto my mask. However, if you have oily skin, you might need to set it with a powder for extra staying power.
Final Verdict:
The Flawless Filter Foundation is a solid foundation with a beautiful finish, I’d go for it!
