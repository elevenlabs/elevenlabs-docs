Hey beauty babes! Blair here, ready to spill the tea on the new Flawless Filter Foundation by Lumina Cosmetics. This foundation has been all over social media, with influencers claiming it delivers flawless, filter-like skin. So, I put it to the test ‚Äì is it all hype or a holy grail product?

Packaging:
The Flawless Filter Foundation comes in a luxurious glass bottle with a pump dispenser. The packaging feels weighty and high-quality, fitting for the price tag.

The foundation boasts a lightweight, buildable formula. It feels comfortable on the skin and doesn't cake up, even when layered for fuller coverage.
