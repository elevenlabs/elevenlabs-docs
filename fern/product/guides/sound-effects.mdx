### Step by step on how to create a Sound Effect

1. **Head over to the Sound Effects section on ElevenLabs.**
2. **In the text box**, type a description of the sound effect you want (e.g., “person walking on grass”).
3. **Click on and adjust the settings:**
   - **Set the duration** for the generated sound.
   - **Use the prompt influence slider** to control how closely the output matches your description.
4. **Generate Sound**.
5. You should have four different sounds generated. If you like none of them, adjust the prompt or settings as needed and regenerate.

**Exercise**: Create a Sound Effect using the following prompt: old-school funky brass stabs from an old vinyl sample, stem, 88bpm in F# minor.

As with Speech Synthesis, you have the option of seeing your generation history; similarly, we have some already-made sound effects for you to check out in the **Explore** tab.
