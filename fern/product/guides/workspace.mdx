Workspaces in ElevenLabs are designed to facilitate collaboration, organization, and governance for Enterprise teams. Once you have been upgraded to Enterprise, your administrator will automatically be granted admin permissions for your workspace.

To get started with your workspace:

- Click on your User Profile at the bottom left of your screen and select Workspace Settings.
  - Here you are able to change the name of your workspace
  - See how many seats and Professional Voice Clones (PVCs) you have associated with your workspace
  - And most importantly add and remove members and select the type of user you would like them to be

<Note>
  **Important**: you are currently only able to invite users that do not have an
  ElevenLabs account already, please reach out to success@elevenlabs.io if you
  are attempting to add someone with an account
</Note>
- Next click on your User Profile again and click on Subscription to view your subscription
details and track your usage. Keep an eye on your usage, and if you are worried you
might be going over your current Tier, we strongly recommend enabling usage-based
billing. This will enable you to exceed the allocated quota and, more importantly,
prevent your account from being blocked if the character quota is reached.
