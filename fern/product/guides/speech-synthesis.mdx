**Speech Synthesis** allows you to generate lifelike speech from text (**Text to Speech**) or audio (**Speech to Speech**) inputs. In this section, you can also see your generation history and thus retrieve past generations.

Selecting **Advanced Mode** allows you to select the model you would like to use for your generation as well as the voice settings (Stability, Similarity, Style, and Speaker Boost) on top of the existing options with Standard.

Let’s touch on models and voice settings briefly before generating our audio clip.

### Models

More detailed information about the models is available [here](product/speech-synthesis/models).

- **Multilingual v2 (default)**: Supports 28 languages, known for its accuracy and stability, especially when using high-quality samples.
- **Turbo v2.5**: Generates speech in 32 languages with low latency, ideal for real-time applications.
- **Turbo v2**: Optimized for low-latency English text-to-speech, similar in performance to Turbo v2.5.
- **English v1**: The oldest and fastest model, best for audiobooks but less accurate.
- **Multilingual v1**: Experimental, surpassed by Multilingual v2, recommended for short text chunks.

### Voice Settings

More detailed information about the voice settings is available [here](product/speech-synthesis/voice-settings).

- **Stability**: Adjusts the emotional range and consistency of the voice. Lower settings result in more variation and emotion, while higher settings produce a more stable, monotone voice.
- **Similarity**: Controls how closely the AI matches the original voice. High settings may replicate artifacts from low-quality audio.
- **Style Exaggeration**: Enhances the speaker's style, but can affect stability.
- **Speaker Boost**: Increases the likeness to the original speaker, useful for weaker voices.

Now that we understand models and voice settings a bit better, let's jump into generating audio!

<Tip>
  Speech to Speech is great for getting the right emotion across when the Text
  to Speech can’t get it right.
