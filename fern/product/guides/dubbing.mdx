**Dubbing Studio** allows you to translate content across 29 languages in seconds with voice translation, speaker detection, and audio dubbing.

Automated Dubbing or Video Translation is a process for translating and replacing the original audio of a video with a new language, while preserving the unique characteristics of the original speakers' voices.

We offer two different types of Dubbing: Automatic and Studio.

**Automatic Dubbing** is the default, so letâ€™s see the step by step for this type of dubbing.

### Step by step for Automatic Dubbing

1. Go to the Dubbing Studio in your Navigation Menu.
2. Enter the dub name and select the original and target languages.
3. Upload a video/audio file or import one via URL (YouTube, TikTok, etc.).
4. Opt for watermarking if needed.
5. Leave the Create a Dubbing Studio project box unchecked.
6. Click on the **Advanced Settings** option:
   - Choose the number of speakers and video resolution.
   - Select the specific range for dubbing if needed.
7. Click on **Create** and sit back while ElevenLabs does its magic.

**Exercise**: Dub the video found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnNFZt0qjD0) from English to Spanish (or a language of your choosing). Select 6 speakers and keep the watermark.

### Dubbing Studio Project

### Step by step for Dubbing using Studio Project:

5. If needed, re-assign clips to the appropriate speaker(s) by dragging and dropping the audio clips from the track to the speaker timeline.
6. Click on the language where you dubbed the video in at the bottom of the screen.
7. You will see a new set of speaker cards appearing next to your transcription, as well as a new set of audio files that are highlighted in sync with the audio timeline.
   - (Optional) If you have made any edits to the transcription, you can re-translate the text by clicking the arrow between the two speaker cards.
   - (Optional) You can assign different voices and/or edit the voice settings for an audio track by clicking the cog icon available next to the speaker's name within the audio track.
8. Use the timeline to view and adjust the placement of voice clips.

   - Merge clips by selecting the merge button between clips in the original audio tracks.
   - Split clips by selecting the split button in the clip panel with the split icon to save time.
10. You can export the final output in various formats and synchronize any video or audio you wish by selecting "Export".
11. Preview the dubbed video, export when ready.
