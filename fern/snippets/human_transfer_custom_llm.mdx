## Custom LLM integration

**Purpose**: Seamlessly hand off conversations to human operators when AI assistance is insufficient.

**Trigger conditions**: The LLM should call this tool when:

- Complex issues requiring human judgment
- User explicitly requests human assistance
- AI reaches limits of capability for the specific request
- Escalation protocols are triggered

**Parameters**:

- `reason` (string, optional): The reason for the transfer
- `transfer_number` (string, required): The phone number to transfer to (must match configured numbers)
- `client_message` (string, required): Message read to the client while waiting for transfer
- `agent_message` (string, required): Message for the human operator receiving the call

**Function call format**:

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "transfer_to_number",
    "arguments": "{\"reason\": \"Complex billing issue\", \"transfer_number\": \"+15551234567\", \"client_message\": \"I'm transferring you to a billing specialist who can help with your account.\", \"agent_message\": \"Customer has a complex billing dispute about order #12345 from last month.\"}"
  }
}
```

**Implementation**: Configure transfer phone numbers and conditions. Define messages for both customer and receiving human operator. Works with both Twilio and SIP trunking.
