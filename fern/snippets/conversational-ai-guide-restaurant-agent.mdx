      </Step>
      <Step title="System prompt">
        This prompt guides the assistant's behavior, tasks, and personality:

        ```plaintext System prompt
        You are a friendly and efficient virtual assistant for Pierogi Palace, a modern Polish restaurant specializing in pierogi. It is located in the Zakopane mountains in Poland.
        Your role is to help customers place orders over voice conversations. You have comprehensive knowledge of the menu items and their prices.

        Menu Items:

        - Potato & Cheese Pierogi – 30 Polish złoty per dozen
        - Beef & Onion Pierogi – 40 Polish złoty per dozen
        - Spinach & Feta Pierogi – 30 Polish złoty per dozen

        Your Tasks:

        1. Greet the Customer: Start with a warm welcome and ask how you can assist.
        2. Take the Order: Listen carefully to the customer's selection, confirm the type and quantity of pierogi.
        3. Confirm Order Details: Repeat the order back to the customer for confirmation.
        4. Calculate Total Price: Compute the total cost based on the items ordered.
        5. Collect Delivery Information: Ask for the customer's delivery address to estimate delivery time.
        6. Estimate Delivery Time: Inform the customer that cooking time is 10 minutes plus delivery time based on their location.
        7. Provide Order Summary: Give the customer a summary of their order, total price, and estimated delivery time.
        8. Close the Conversation: Thank the customer and let them know their order is being prepared.

        Guidelines:

        - Use a friendly and professional tone throughout the conversation.
        - Be patient and attentive to the customer's needs.
        - If unsure about any information, politely ask the customer to repeat or clarify.
        - Do not collect any payment information; inform the customer that payment will be handled upon delivery.
        - Avoid discussing topics unrelated to taking and managing the order.
        ```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a voice">
    In the **Voice** tab, choose a voice that best matches your assistant from the [voice library](https://elevenlabs.io/community):

      ![Voice settings](/assets/images/conversational-ai/voice-settings.jpg)
    </Frame>
   <Note> Using higher quality voices, models, and LLMs may increase response time. For an optimal customer experience, balance quality and latency based on your assistant's expected use case.</Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Testing your assistant">
     Press the **Test AI agent** button and try ordering some pierogi.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Analyze and collect conversation data

Configure evaluation criteria and data collection to analyze conversations and improve your assistant's performance.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure evaluation criteria">
    Navigate to the **Analysis** tab in your assistant's settings to define custom criteria for evaluating conversations.

    <Frame background="subtle">
      ![Analysis settings](/assets/images/conversational-ai/analysis-settings.png)
    </Frame>

    Every conversation transcript is passed to the LLM to verify if specific goals were met. Results will either be `success`, `failure`, or `unknown`, along with a rationale explaining the chosen result.

    Let's add an evaluation criteria with the name `order_completion`:

    ```plaintext Prompt
    Evaluate if the conversation resulted in a successful order.
    Success criteria:
    - Customer selected at least one pierogi variety
    - Quantity was confirmed
    - Delivery address was provided
    - Total price was communicated
    - Delivery time estimate was given
    Return "success" only if ALL criteria are met.
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure data collection">
    In the **Data Collection** section, configure details to be extracted from each conversation.

    Click **Add item** and configure the following:

    1. **Data type:** Select "string"
    2. **Identifier:** Enter a unique identifier for this data point: `order_details`
    3. **Description:** Provide detailed instructions for the LLM about how to extract the specific data from the transcript:

    ```plaintext Prompt
    Extract order details from the conversation, including:
    - Type of order (delivery, pickup, inquiry_only)
    - List of pierogi varieties and quantities ordered in the format: "item: quantity"
    - Delivery zone based on the address (central_zakopane, outer_zakopane, outside_delivery_zone)
    - Interaction type (completed_order, abandoned_order, menu_inquiry, general_inquiry)
    If no order was placed, return "none"
    ```
    <Tip>Test your assistant by posing as a customer. Order pierogi, ask questions, evaluate its responses, and tweak the prompts until you're happy with how it performs.</Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="View conversation history">
    View evaluation results and collected data for each conversation in the **Call history** tab.
    <Frame background="subtle">
      ![Conversation history](/assets/images/conversational-ai/transcript.jpg)
    </Frame>
    <Tip>Regularly review conversation history to identify common issues and patterns.</Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your assistant is now configured & ready to take orders.
