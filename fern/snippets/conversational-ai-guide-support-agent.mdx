  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the assistant behavior">
   Go to the **Agent** tab to configure the assistant's behavior. Set the following:
    <Steps>
      <Step title="First message">
        This is the first message the assistant will speak out loud when a user starts a conversation.

        ```plaintext First message
        Hi, this is Alexis from <company name> support. How can I help you today?
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="System prompt">
        This prompt guides the assistant's behavior, tasks, and personality.

        Customize the following example with your company details:
        ```plaintext System prompt
        You are a friendly and efficient virtual assistant for [Your Company Name]. Your role is to assist customers by answering questions about the company's products, services, and documentation. You should use the provided knowledge base to offer accurate and helpful responses.

        Tasks:
        - Answer Questions: Provide clear and concise answers based on the available information.
        - Clarify Unclear Requests: Politely ask for more details if the customer's question is not clear.

        Guidelines:
        - Maintain a friendly and professional tone throughout the conversation.
        - Be patient and attentive to the customer's needs.
        - If unsure about any information, politely ask the customer to repeat or clarify.
        - Avoid discussing topics unrelated to the company's products or services.
        - Aim to provide concise answers. Limit responses to a couple of sentences and let the user guide you on where to provide more detail.
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a knowledge base">
    Go to the **Knowledge Base** section to provide your assistant with context about your business. 
    
    This is where you can upload relevant documents & links to external resources:

    - Include documentation, FAQs, and other resources to help the assistant respond to customer inquiries.
    - Keep the knowledge base up-to-date to ensure the assistant provides accurate and current information.

### Configure the voice

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a voice">
    In the **Voice** tab, choose a voice that best matches your assistant from the [voice library](https://elevenlabs.io/community):

      ![Voice settings](/assets/images/conversational-ai/voice-settings.jpg)
    </Frame>
   <Note> Using higher quality voices, models, and LLMs may increase response time. For an optimal customer experience, balance quality and latency based on your assistant's expected use case.</Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Testing your assistant">
     Press the **Test AI agent** button and try conversing with your assistant.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Analyze and collect conversation data

Configure evaluation criteria and data collection to analyze conversations and improve your assistant's performance.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure evaluation criteria">
    Navigate to the **Analysis** tab in your assistant's settings to define custom criteria for evaluating conversations.

    <Frame background="subtle">
      ![Analysis settings](/assets/images/conversational-ai/analysis-settings.png)
    </Frame>

    Every conversation transcript is passed to the LLM to verify if specific goals were met. Results will either be `success`, `failure`, or `unknown`, along with a rationale explaining the chosen result.

    Let's add an evaluation criteria with the name `solved_user_inquiry`:

    ```plaintext Prompt
    The assistant was able to answer all of the queries or redirect them to a relevant support channel.

    Success Criteria:
    - All user queries were answered satisfactorily.
    - The user was redirected to a relevant support channel if needed.
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure data collection">
    In the **Data Collection** section, configure details to be extracted from each conversation.

    Click **Add item** and configure the following:

    1. **Data type:** Select "string"
    2. **Identifier:** Enter a unique identifier for this data point: `user_question`
    3. **Description:** Provide detailed instructions for the LLM about how to extract the specific data from the transcript:

    ```plaintext Prompt
    Extract the user's questions & inquiries from the conversation.
    ```
    <Tip>Test your assistant by posing as a customer. Ask questions, evaluate its responses, and tweak the prompts until you're happy with how it performs.</Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="View conversation history">
    View evaluation results and collected data for each conversation in the **Call history** tab.
    <Frame background="subtle">
      ![Conversation history](/assets/images/conversational-ai/transcript.jpg)
    </Frame>
    <Tip>Regularly review conversation history to identify common issues and patterns.</Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your assistant is now configured. Embed the widget on your website to start providing real-time support to your customers.
