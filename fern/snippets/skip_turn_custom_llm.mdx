## Custom LLM integration

**Purpose**: Allow the agent to pause and wait for user input without speaking.

**Trigger conditions**: The LLM should call this tool when:

- User indicates they need a moment ("Give me a second", "Let me think")
- User requests pause in conversation flow
- Agent detects user needs time to process information

**Parameters**:

- `reason` (string, optional): Free-form reason explaining why the pause is needed

**Function call format**:

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "skip_turn",
    "arguments": "{\"reason\": \"User requested time to think\"}"
  }
}
```

**Implementation**: No additional configuration needed. The tool simply signals the agent to remain silent until the user speaks again.
