## Custom LLM integration

**Purpose**: Automatically switch to the user's detected language during conversations.

**Trigger conditions**: The LLM should call this tool when:

- User speaks in a different language than the current conversation language
- User explicitly requests to switch languages
- Multi-language support is needed for the conversation

**Parameters**:

- `reason` (string, required): The reason for the language switch
- `language` (string, required): The language code to switch to (must be in supported languages list)

**Function call format**:

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "language_detection",
    "arguments": "{\"reason\": \"User requested Spanish\", \"language\": \"es\"}"
  }
}
```

**Implementation**: Configure supported languages in agent settings and add the language detection system tool. The agent will automatically switch voice and responses to match detected languages.
