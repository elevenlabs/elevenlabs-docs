## Custom LLM integration

**Purpose**: Transfer conversations between specialized AI agents based on user needs.

**Trigger conditions**: The LLM should call this tool when:

- User request requires specialized knowledge or different agent capabilities
- Current agent cannot adequately handle the query
- Conversation flow indicates need for different agent type

**Parameters**:

- `reason` (string, optional): The reason for the agent transfer
- `agent_number` (integer, required): Zero-indexed number of the agent to transfer to (based on configured transfer rules)

**Function call format**:

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "transfer_to_agent",
    "arguments": "{\"reason\": \"User needs billing support\", \"agent_number\": 0}"
  }
}
```

**Implementation**: Define transfer rules mapping conditions to specific agent IDs. Configure which agents the current agent can transfer to. Agents are referenced by zero-indexed numbers in the transfer configuration.
