## Custom LLM integration

**Purpose**: Automatically terminate conversations when appropriate conditions are met.

**Trigger conditions**: The LLM should call this tool when:

- The main task has been completed and user is satisfied
- The conversation reached natural conclusion with mutual agreement
- The user explicitly indicates they want to end the conversation

**Parameters**:

- `reason` (string, required): The reason for ending the call
- `message` (string, optional): A farewell message to send to the user before ending the call

**Function call format**:

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "end_call",
    "arguments": "{\"reason\": \"Task completed successfully\", \"message\": \"Thank you for using our service. Have a great day!\"}"
  }
}
```

**Implementation**: Configure as a system tool in your agent settings. The LLM will receive detailed instructions about when to call this function.
