## Custom LLM integration

**Parameters**:

- `reason` (string, required): The specific reason for detecting voicemail, referencing the exact wording that indicated voicemail (e.g., "automated greeting detected: 'You have reached the voicemail of...'")

**Function call format**:

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "voicemail_detection",
    "arguments": "{\"reason\": \"automated greeting detected: 'Hi, you've reached Sarah. I'm not available right now. Please leave a message after the beep.'\"}"
  }
}
```

**Important considerations**:

- This tool is designed specifically for **outbound calls** and will not work effectively on inbound calls or transfer scenarios
- The agent must provide a specific reason that references the actual voicemail content heard
- After calling this function, the call will end immediately (or after playing a configured voicemail message)
- Only use when you're certain the call has been answered by an automated voicemail system, not a human
