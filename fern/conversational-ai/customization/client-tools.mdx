Enhance your conversational AI agents by integrating client-side events that can trigger actions on the user's frontend. Unlike server-side webhooks, client tools operate directly in the user's browser, allowing agents to perform actions like opening modals, making API calls, or executing custom functions during conversations.

## What You'll Need

- An [ElevenLabs account](https://elevenlabs.io)
- A configured ElevenLabs Conversational Agent ([create one here](/docs/conversational-ai/docs/agent-setup))
- Python 3.7+ or Node.js 16+

## Creating Your First Client-Side Event

Follow these steps to set up a client-side event that triggers a browser alert.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new tool in your agent">
    1. Navigate to your agent dashboard.
    2. In the **Tools** section, click **Add Tool**.
    
    <Frame>

    </Frame>
  </Step>

<Step title="Configure the tool">

    - **Name**: `triggerBrowserAlert`
    - **Description**: *Triggers a real-time alert in the user's browser. Use this tool for urgent notifications, reminders, or time-sensitive updates that require immediate user action.*
    - **Parameters**:
      - `message` (string): The message to display in the alert. The LLM should extract relevant text from the conversation, ensuring it is actionable and concise.

</Step>

  <Step title="Implement the client tool in your code">
    Depending on your development environment, add the following code to integrate the client tool.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```javascript JavaScript
      const conversation = await Conversation.startSession({
        signedUrl: signedUrl,
        clientTools: {
          triggerBrowserAlert: async (parameters) => {
            alert(parameters.message);
          }
        },
        // ... other configurations ...
      });
      ```

      ```swift Swift
      // Create client tools instance
      var clientTools = ElevenLabsSDK.ClientTools()

      // Register a custom tool with an async handler
      clientTools.register("triggerBrowserAlert") { parameters async throws -> String? in
          // Parameters is a [String: Any] dictionary
          guard let joke = parameters["message"] as? String else {
              throw ElevenLabsSDK.ClientToolError.invalidParameters
          }
          print("Trigger an alert with the message: \(message)")
          return message
      }
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Note>
    - Ensure that the `clientTools` name (`triggerBrowserAlert`) matches the tool name you set in the agent configuration.
    - The `message` parameter should align with the agentâ€™s output.
    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the client-side event">
    Initiate a conversation with your agent and say something like:

    > "Trigger an alert that says 'Hello World'"

    You should see a browser alert pop up with the message.

    <Frame>
      <img width="400" src="../images/client-tools-2.png" alt="Browser alert triggered by client tool" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Now that you've set up a basic client-side event, you can:

- Explore more complex client tools like opening modals, navigating to pages, or interacting with the DOM.
- Combine client tools with server-side webhooks for full-stack interactions.
- Use client tools to enhance user engagement and provide real-time feedback during conversations.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Client tool not triggering">
    - Ensure that the tool name in your code matches exactly with the tool name
    in the agent configuration. - Check that the agent is correctly outputting
    the tool command in the conversation. - Verify there are no typos in the
    parameter names.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="JavaScript errors in the browser">
    - Open the browser console to check for any errors. - Ensure that your code
    has necessary error handling for undefined or unexpected parameters.
