Knowledge bases allow you to provide additional context to your conversational
agent beyond its base LLM knowledge.

  Non-enterprise users can add up to 5 files/links (max 20MB, 300,000 characters
  total).

## Adding Knowledge Items

There are 3 options to enhance your conversational agent's knowledge:

### 1. File Upload
