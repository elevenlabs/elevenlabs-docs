## What is Conversational AI?

ElevenLabs [Conversational AI](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai) is a platform for deploying customized, conversational voice agents. Built in response to our customers' needs, our platform eliminates months of development time typically spent building conversation stacks from scratch. It combines these building blocks:
