## What is Conversational AI?

ElevenLabs [Conversational AI](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai) is a platform for deploying customized, conversational voice agents. Built in response to our customers' needs, our platform eliminates months of development time typically spent building conversation stacks from scratch. It combines these building blocks:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Speech to text">
    Our fine tuned ASR model that transcribes the caller's dialogue.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Language model">
    Choose from Gemini, Claude, OpenAI and more, or bring your own.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Text to speech">
    Our low latency, human-like TTS across 5k+ voices and 31 languages.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Turn taking model">
    Our custom turn taking model that understands when to speak, like a human would.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Altogether it is a highly composable AI Voice agent solution that can scale to thousands of calls per day. With [server](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools/server-tools) & [client side](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools/client-tools) tools, [knowledge](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/knowledge-base) bases, [dynamic](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/personalization/dynamic-variables) agent instantiation and [overrides](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/personalization/overrides), plus built-in monitoring, it's the complete developer toolkit.

<Note>
  Usage is billed to the account that created the agent. If authentication is not enabled, anybody
  with your agent's id can connect to it and consume your credits. To protect against this, either
  enable authentication for your agent or handle the agent id as a secret.

### Pricing during silent periods

When a conversation is silent for longer than ten seconds, ElevenLabs reduces the inference of the turn-taking model and speech-to-text services until voice activity is detected again. This optimization means that extended periods of silence are charged at 5% of the usual per-minute cost.

This reduction in cost:

- Only applies to the period of silence.
- Does not apply after voice activity is detected again.
- Can be triggered at multiple times in the same conversation.

## Models

Currently, the following models are natively supported and can be configured via the agent settings:
