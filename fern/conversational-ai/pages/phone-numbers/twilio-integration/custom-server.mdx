## Overview

This guide shows you how to set up a custom server to handle advanced Twilio integrations with your ElevenLabs conversational AI agents. A custom server approach gives you more control over call handling, webhook processing, and integration with your existing systems.

## Prerequisites

- A [Twilio account](https://twilio.com/)
- A purchased & provisioned Twilio [phone number](https://www.twilio.com/docs/phone-numbers)
- A server capable of handling HTTP webhooks
- Basic knowledge of Twilio's Voice API

## Setup

### Configure Twilio webhooks

Configure your Twilio phone number to send webhook requests to your custom server:

1. In your Twilio Console, navigate to Phone Numbers > Manage > Active numbers
2. Select your phone number
3. Set the webhook URL for voice calls to your server endpoint
4. Configure the HTTP method (POST recommended)

### Handle incoming calls

Your custom server should handle incoming webhook requests from Twilio and integrate with ElevenLabs:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/voice', methods=['POST'])
def handle_voice():
    # Extract call information from Twilio webhook
    call_sid = request.form.get('CallSid')
    from_number = request.form.get('From')
    to_number = request.form.get('To')

    # Process call with ElevenLabs
    # Your integration logic here

    return twiml_response

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Integration with ElevenLabs

Connect your custom server to ElevenLabs conversational AI:

1. Use the ElevenLabs API to initiate conversations
2. Handle audio streaming between Twilio and ElevenLabs
3. Process conversation events and responses

## Advanced features

- Custom call routing logic
- Integration with existing CRM systems
- Advanced analytics and logging
- Custom authentication and security measures

## Security considerations

- Use HTTPS for all webhook endpoints
- Validate Twilio webhook signatures
- Implement proper authentication for sensitive operations
- Store credentials securely

## Next steps

For simpler integrations, consider using the [native Twilio integration](/docs/conversational-ai/phone-numbers/twilio-integration/native-integration) instead.
