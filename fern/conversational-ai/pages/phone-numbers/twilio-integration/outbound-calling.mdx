## Overview

This guide shows you how to initiate outbound calls using your ElevenLabs conversational AI agents with Twilio phone numbers. Outbound calling enables your agents to proactively reach out to customers for notifications, surveys, follow-ups, and other business communications.

## Prerequisites

- A [Twilio account](https://twilio.com/)
- A purchased & provisioned Twilio [phone number](https://www.twilio.com/docs/phone-numbers)
- An ElevenLabs conversational AI agent
- Integration set up between Twilio and ElevenLabs

## Making outbound calls

### Using the dashboard

The easiest way to make outbound calls is through the ElevenLabs dashboard:

1. Navigate to [Phone Numbers](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/phone-numbers)
2. Find your Twilio phone number
3. Click the **Outbound call** button
4. Configure the call parameters:
   - Select the agent to handle the conversation
   - Enter the destination phone number
   - Add any personalization data if needed
5. Click **Send Test Call** to initiate the call

### Using the API

For programmatic outbound calling, use the ElevenLabs API:

```python
import requests

# API endpoint for outbound calls
url = "https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversations/phone"

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

data = {
    "agent_id": "your-agent-id",
    "phone_number": "+1234567890",
    "phone_number_id": "your-twilio-phone-number-id"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
```

### Batch calling

For calling multiple recipients, use the [batch calling feature](/docs/conversational-ai/workflows/batch-calling):

1. Upload a CSV file with recipient phone numbers
2. Select your agent and phone number
3. Schedule or send immediately
4. Monitor progress in the dashboard
