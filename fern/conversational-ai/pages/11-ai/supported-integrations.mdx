subtitle: Learn about third-party integrations and their automatic Zero Retention Mode (ZRM) requirements for data privacy and compliance.
---

## Overview

11.ai supports various third-party integrations to seamlessly connect with your everyday applications. Some integrations automatically enable Zero Retention Mode (ZRM) to ensure compliance with industry regulations and data privacy requirements.

<Warning>
  When any integration marked with ZRM is added to an agent, all conversation data is processed in
  Zero Retention Mode, meaning no conversation transcripts, audio recordings, or personally
  identifiable information (PII) is stored or logged by ElevenLabs.
</Warning>

## Zero Retention Mode enforcement

As soon as any integration that requires ZRM is added to an agent, the entire agent automatically operates in Zero Retention Mode. This ensures:

- No call recordings are stored
- No conversation transcripts containing PII are logged
- All data is processed only in volatile memory during the request
- Compliance with healthcare (HIPAA), financial, and other regulatory requirements

## Integrations with Zero Retention Mode

The following integrations automatically enforce Zero Retention Mode to ensure compliance with data privacy policies:

| Integration     | Description                     | ZRM | Use Case                     | Compliance Requirements                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | :-: | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Gmail           | Email management service        | ✅  | Email reading, organization  | Google Workspace APIs Limited Use policy |
| Google Calendar | Calendar and scheduling service | ✅  | Event management, scheduling | Google Workspace APIs Limited Use policy |

## Google Workspace API compliance

Google integrations require Zero Retention Mode to comply with Google's Workspace APIs data policy requirements:

- **Limited Use requirements**: User data from Workspace APIs cannot be used for foundational AI/ML model training
- **Data retention restrictions**: No permanent copies of user content are created or cached beyond permitted timeframes
- **Express permission mandate**: All content access requires explicit user consent
- **Security assessment**: CASA (Cloud Application Security Assessment) certification required for restricted API scopes

<Warning>
  Google Workspace integrations are subject to additional compliance requirements and security
  assessments. Data from these integrations is processed exclusively in Zero Retention Mode with no
  storage or logging of user content.
</Warning>

<Note>
  This list is regularly updated as new integrations become available. For the most current
  information about specific integrations, please contact your ElevenLabs representative.
