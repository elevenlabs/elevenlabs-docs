## Overview

Pronunciation dictionaries allow you to customize how your AI agent pronounces specific words or phrases. This is particularly useful for:

- Correcting pronunciation of names, places, or technical terms
- Ensuring consistent pronunciation across conversations
- Customizing regional pronunciation variations

## Configuration

You can find the pronunciation dictionary settings under the **Voice** tab in your agent's configuration.

<Note>
  The phoneme function of pronunciation dictionaries only works with the Turbo v2 model, while the
  alias function works with all models.
</Note>

## Dictionary file format

Pronunciation dictionaries use XML-based `.pls` files. Here's an example structure:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<lexicon version="1.0"
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/01/pronunciation-lexicon"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.w3.org/2005/01/pronunciation-lexicon
        http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/CR-pronunciation-lexicon-20071212/pls.xsd"
      alphabet="ipa" xml:lang="en-GB">
  <lexeme>
    <grapheme>Apple</grapheme>
    <phoneme>ˈæpl̩</phoneme>
  </lexeme>
  <lexeme>
    <grapheme>UN</grapheme>
    <alias>United Nations</alias>
  </lexeme>
</lexicon>
```

## Supported formats

We support two types of pronunciation notation:

1. **IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)**

   - More precise control over pronunciation
   - Requires knowledge of IPA symbols
   - Example: "nginx" as `/ˈɛndʒɪnˈɛks/`

2. **CMU (Carnegie Mellon University) Dictionary format**
   - Simpler ASCII-based format
   - More accessible for English pronunciations
   - Example: "tomato" as "T AH M EY T OW"

<Tip>
  You can use AI tools like Claude or ChatGPT to help generate IPA or CMU notations for specific
  words.

## Best practices

1. **Case sensitivity**: Create separate entries for capitalized and lowercase versions of words if needed
2. **Testing**: Always test pronunciations with your chosen voice and model
3. **Maintenance**: Keep your dictionary organized and documented
4. **Scope**: Focus on words that are frequently mispronounced or critical to your use case
