## Overview

The speed control feature allows you to adjust how quickly or slowly your agent speaks. This can be useful for:

- Making speech more accessible for different audiences
- Matching specific use cases (e.g., slower for educational content)
- Optimizing for different types of conversations

## Configuration

Speed is controlled through the [`speed` parameter](/docs/api-reference/agents/create-agent#request.body.conversation_config.tts.speed) with the following specifications:

- **Range**: 0.7 to 1.2
- **Default**: 1.0
- **Type**: Optional

## How it works

The speed parameter affects the pace of speech generation:

- Values below 1.0 slow down the speech
- Values above 1.0 speed up the speech
- 1.0 represents normal speaking speed

<Note>
  Extreme values near the minimum or maximum may affect the quality of the generated speech.
</Note>

## Best practices

- Start with the default speed (1.0) and adjust based on user feedback
- Test different speeds with your specific content
- Consider your target audience when setting the speed
- Monitor speech quality at extreme values

<Warning>Values outside the 0.7-1.2 range are not supported.</Warning>
