title: Multi-voice support
subtitle: Enable your AI agent to switch between different voices for multi-character conversations and enhanced storytelling.
---

## Overview

Multi-voice support allows your conversational AI agent to dynamically switch between different ElevenLabs voices during a single conversation. This powerful feature enables:

- **Multi-character storytelling**: Different voices for different characters in narratives
- **Language tutoring**: Native speaker voices for different languages
- **Emotional agents**: Voice changes based on emotional context
- **Role-playing scenarios**: Distinct voices for different personas

</Frame>

## How it works

When multi-voice support is enabled, your agent can use XML-style markup to switch between configured voices during text generation. The agent automatically returns to the default voice when no specific voice is specified.

<CodeBlocks>
```xml title="Example voice switching"
The teacher said, <spanish>¡Hola estudiantes!</spanish> 
Then the student replied, <student>Hello! How are you today?</student>
```

```xml title="Multi-character dialogue"
<narrator>Once upon a time, in a distant kingdom...</narrator>
<princess>I need to find the magic crystal!</princess>
<wizard>The crystal lies beyond the enchanted forest.</wizard>
```

</CodeBlocks>

## Configuration

### Adding supported voices

Navigate to your agent settings and locate the **Multi-voice support** section under the `Voice` tab.

<Steps>

### Add a new voice

Click **Add voice** to configure a new supported voice for your agent.

    alt="Multi-voice configuration interface"
  />
</Frame>

### Configure voice properties

Set up the voice with the following details:

- **Voice label**: Unique identifier (e.g., "Joe", "Spanish", "Happy")
- **Voice**: Select from your available ElevenLabs voices
- **Model Family**: Choose Turbo, Flash, or Multilingual (optional)
- **Language**: Override the default language for this voice (optional)
- **Description**: When the agent should use this voice

### Save configuration

Click **Add voice** to save the configuration. The voice will be available for your agent to use immediately.

</Steps>

### Voice properties

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Voice label">
    A unique identifier that the LLM uses to reference this voice. Choose descriptive labels like: -
    Character names: "Alice", "Bob", "Narrator" - Languages: "Spanish", "French", "German" -
    Emotions: "Happy", "Sad", "Excited" - Roles: "Teacher", "Student", "Guide"
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Model family">
  Override the agent's default model family for this specific voice: - **Flash**: Fastest eneration,
  optimized for real-time use - **Turbo**: Balanced speed and quality - **Multilingual**: Highest
  quality, best for non-English languages - **Same as agent**: Use agent's default setting
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Language override">
  Specify a different language for this voice, useful for: - Multilingual conversations - Language
  tutoring applications - Region-specific pronunciations
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Description">
    Provide context for when the agent should use this voice. 
    Examples: 
    - "For any Spanish words or phrases" 
    - "When the message content is joyful or excited" 
    - "Whenever the character Joe is speaking"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Implementation

### XML markup syntax

Your agent uses XML-style tags to switch between voices:

```xml
<VOICE_LABEL>text to be spoken</VOICE_LABEL>
```

**Key points:**

- Replace `VOICE_LABEL` with the exact label you configured
- Text outside tags uses the default voice
- Tags are case-sensitive
- Nested tags are not supported

### System prompt integration

When you configure supported voices, the system automatically adds instructions to your agent's prompt:

```
When a message should be spoken by a particular person, use markup: "<CHARACTER>message</CHARACTER>" where CHARACTER is the character label.

Available voices are as follows:
- default: any text outside of the CHARACTER tags
- Joe: Whenever Joe is speaking
- Spanish: For any Spanish words or phrases
- Narrator: For narrative descriptions
```

### Example usage

<Tabs>

    <Tab title="Language tutoring">
        ```
        Teacher: Let's practice greetings. In Spanish, we say <Spanish>¡Hola! ¿Cómo estás?</Spanish>
        Student: How do I respond?
        Teacher: You can say <Spanish>¡Hola! Estoy bien, gracias.</Spanish> which means Hello! I'm fine, thank you.
        ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Storytelling">
      ```
      Once upon a time, a brave princess ventured into a dark cave.
      <Princess>I'm not afraid of you, dragon!</Princess> she declared boldly. The dragon rumbled from
      the shadows, <Dragon>You should be, little one.</Dragon>
      But the princess stood her ground, ready for whatever came next.
      ```
    </Tab>

</Tabs>

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Voice selection">

- Choose voices that clearly differentiate between characters or contexts
- Test voice combinations to ensure they work well together
- Consider the emotional tone and personality for each voice
- Ensure voices match the language and accent when switching languages

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Label naming">

- Use descriptive, intuitive labels that the LLM can understand
- Keep labels short and memorable
- Avoid special characters or spaces in labels

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Performance optimization">

- Limit the number of supported voices to what you actually need
- Use the same model family when possible to reduce switching overhead
- Test with your expected conversation patterns
- Monitor response times with multiple voice switches

</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Content guidelines">
    - Provide clear descriptions for when each voice should be used 
    - Test edge cases where voice switching might be unclear
     - Consider fallback behavior when voice labels are ambiguous 
     - Ensure voice switches enhance rather than distract from the conversation
  </Accordion>
  
</AccordionGroup>

## Limitations

<Note>

- Maximum of 10 supported voices per agent (including default)
- Voice switching adds minimal latency during generation
- XML tags must be properly formatted and closed
- Voice labels are case-sensitive in markup
- Nested voice tags are not supported

</Note>

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="What happens if I use an undefined voice label?">
        If the agent uses a voice label that hasn't been configured, the text will be spoken using the
        default voice. The XML tags will be ignored.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I change voices mid-sentence?">
    Yes, you can switch voices within a single response. Each tagged section will use the specified
    voice, while untagged text uses the default voice.
    </Accordion>


    <Accordion title="Do voice switches affect conversation latency?">
    Voice switching adds minimal overhead. The first use of each voice in a conversation may have
    slightly higher latency as the voice is initialized.
    </Accordion>


    <Accordion title="Can I use the same voice with different labels?">
    Yes, you can configure multiple labels that use the same ElevenLabs voice but with different model
    families, languages, or contexts.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I train my agent to use voice switching effectively?">
        Provide clear examples in your system prompt and test thoroughly. You can include specific
        scenarios where voice switching should occur and examples of the XML markup format.
