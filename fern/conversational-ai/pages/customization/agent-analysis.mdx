## Overview

The Conversational AI platform provides two complementary analysis capabilities:

- **Success Evaluation**: Define custom metrics to assess conversation quality, goal achievement, and customer satisfaction
- **Data Collection**: Extract specific data points from conversations such as contact information, issue details, or any structured information

Both features process conversation transcripts using advanced language models to provide actionable insights that improve agent performance and business outcomes.
