subtitle: Control whether call audio recordings are retained.
---

**Audio Saving** settings allow you to choose whether recordings of your calls are retained in your call history, on a per-agent basis. This control gives you flexibility over data storage and privacy.

## Overview

By default, audio recordings are enabled. You can modify this setting to:

- **Enable audio saving**: Save call audio for later review.
- **Disable audio saving**: Omit audio recordings from your call history.

<Info>
  Disabling audio saving enhances privacy but limits the ability to review calls. However,
  transcripts can still be viewed. To modify transcript retention settings, please refer to the
  [retention](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/privacy/retention) documentation.
