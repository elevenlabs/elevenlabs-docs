subtitle: Control how long your agent retains conversation history and recordings.

**Retention** settings allow you to configure how long your Conversational AI agent stores conversation transcripts and audio recordings. These settings help you comply with data privacy regulations.

## Overview

By default, ElevenLabs retains conversation data for 2 years. You can modify this period to:

- Any number of days (e.g., 30, 90, 365)
- Unlimited retention by setting the value to -1
- Immediate deletion by setting the value to 0

The retention settings apply separately to:

- **Conversation transcripts**: Text records of all interactions
- **Audio recordings**: Voice recordings from both the user and agent

<Info>
  For GDPR compliance, we recommend setting retention periods that align with your data processing
  purposes. For HIPAA compliance, retain records for a minimum of 6 years.
