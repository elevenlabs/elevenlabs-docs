## Overview

Events are the foundation of real-time communication in conversational AI applications using WebSockets.
They facilitate the exchange of information like audio streams, transcriptions, agent responses, and contextual updates between the client application and the server infrastructure.

Understanding these events is crucial for building responsive and interactive conversational experiences.

Events are broken down into two categories:
