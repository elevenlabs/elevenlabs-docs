## Overview

Interruption handling determines whether users can interrupt your assistant while it's speaking. This behavior can be enabled or disabled based on your use case.

## Configuration

Interruption settings can be configured in the **Advanced** tab under **Client Events**.

To enable interruptions, make sure interruption is a selected client event.

<Note>
  Disable interruptions when the complete delivery of information is crucial, such as legal
  disclaimers or safety instructions.
</Note>

## Best practices

- Enable interruptions for natural conversational flows where back-and-forth dialogue is expected
- Disable interruptions when message completion is critical (e.g., terms and conditions, safety information)
- Consider your use case context - customer service may benefit from interruptions while information delivery may not
