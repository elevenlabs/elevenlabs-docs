## Overview

Zero Retention Mode (ZRM) enhances data privacy by ensuring that no Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is logged during or stored after a call. This feature can be enabled on a per-agent basis for workspaces that do not have ZRM enforced globally. For workspaces with global ZRM enabled, all agents will automatically operate in Zero Retention Mode.

When ZRM is active for an agent:

- No call recordings will be stored.
- No transcripts or call metadata containing PII will be logged or stored by our systems post-call.

<Note>
  For workspaces where Zero Retention Mode is enforced globally, this setting will be automatically
  enabled for all agents and cannot be disabled on a per-agent basis.
</Note>

To retrieve information about calls made with ZRM-enabled agents, you must use [post-call webhooks](/docs/conversational-ai/workflows/post-call-webhooks).

<Warning>
  Enabling Zero Retention Mode may impact ElevenLabs' ability to debug call-related issues for the
  specific agent, as limited logs or call data will be available for review.
</Warning>

## How to Enable ZRM per Agent

For workspaces not operating under global Zero Retention Mode, you can enable ZRM for individual agents:

1.  Navigate to your agent's settings.
2.  Go to the **Privacy** settings block.
3.  Select the **Advanced** tab.
4.  Toggle the "Zero Retention Mode" option to enabled.
