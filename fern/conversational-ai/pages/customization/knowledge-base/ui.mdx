## Adding existing documents to agents

When configuring an agent's knowledge base, you can easily add existing documents to an agent.

1. Navigate to the agent's [configuration](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/)
2. Click "Add document" in the knowledge base section of the "Agent" tab.
3. The option to select from your existing knowledge base documents or upload a new document will appear.

<Tip>
  Documents can be reused across multiple agents, making it efficient to maintain consistent
  knowledge across your workspace.

## Document dependencies

Each document in your knowledge base includes a "Agents" tab that shows which agents currently depend on that document.

It is not possible to delete a document if any agent depends on it.
