## Adding existing documents to agents

When configuring an agent's knowledge base, you can easily add existing documents to an agent.

1. Navigate to the agent's [configuration](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/)
2. Click "Add document" in the Knowledge Base section of the `Agent` tab.
3. The option will appear to select from your existing Knowledge Base documents or upload a new document.

<Tip>
  Documents can be reused across multiple agents, making it efficient to maintain consistent
  knowledge across your workspace.

## Document dependencies

Each document in your knowledge base includes a "Agents" tab that shows which agents are currently dependent on that document.

It is not possible to delete a document if any agent is dependent on it.
