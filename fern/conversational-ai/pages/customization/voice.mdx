## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Voice selection">
    Choose voices that match your target language and region for the most natural pronunciation.
    Consider testing multiple voices to find the best fit for your use case.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Speed optimization">
    Start with the default speed (1.0) and adjust based on your specific needs. Test different
    speeds with your content to find the optimal balance between clarity and natural flow.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pronunciation dictionaries">
    Focus on terms specific to your business or use case that need consistent pronunciation and are
    not widely used in everyday conversation. Test pronunciations with your chosen voice and model
    combination.

  control is only available with the Turbo v2 model.
