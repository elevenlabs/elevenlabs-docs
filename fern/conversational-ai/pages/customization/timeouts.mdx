title: Timeouts
subtitle: Configure how your assistant handles periods of user silence.
---

## Overview

Timeout handling determines how long your assistant will wait during periods of user silence before prompting for a response. This helps create more natural conversations and handles cases where user responses may not be properly detected.

## Configuration

Timeout settings can be configured in the **Advanced** tab under **Turn Timeout**.

The timeout duration is specified in seconds and determines how long the assistant will wait in silence before prompting the user.

Turn timeouts must be between 1 and 30 seconds.

#### Example Timeout Settings

<Note>
  Choose an appropriate timeout duration based on your use case. Shorter timeouts create more
  responsive conversations but may interrupt users who need more time to respond, leading to a less
  natural conversation.
</Note>

## Best practices

- Set shorter timeouts (5-10 seconds) for casual conversations where quick back-and-forth is expected
- Use longer timeouts (10-30 seconds) when users may need more time to think or formulate complex responses
- Consider your user context - customer service may benefit from shorter timeouts while technical support may need longer ones
