## Overview

You can require callers to accept terms and conditions before initiating a conversation with your assistant. When enabled, users must explicitly agree to your terms before proceeding.

<Info>
  Once accepted, the status is stored locally and the user won't be prompted again on subsequent
  visits.
</Info>

## Configuration

Enable and customize terms under the **Widget** tab:

The terms are displayed to users in a modal before starting the call:

## Customization

The terms can be written in Markdown, allowing you to:

- Add links to external policies
- Format text with headers and lists
- Include emphasis and styling

For more help with Markdown, see the [CommonMark help guide](https://commonmark.org/help/).
