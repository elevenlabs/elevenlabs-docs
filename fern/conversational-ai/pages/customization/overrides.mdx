title: Overrides
subtitle: Tailor each conversation with personalized context for each user.

<Warning>
  While overrides are still supported for completely replacing system prompts or first messages, we
  recommend using [Dynamic Variables](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/dynamic-variables) as
  the preferred way to customize your agent's responses and inject real-time data. Dynamic Variables
  offer better maintainability and a more structured approach to personalization.
</Warning>

**Overrides** enable your assistant to adapt its behavior for each user interaction. You can pass custom data and settings at the start of each conversation, allowing the assistant to personalize its responses and knowledge with real-time context.
Overrides completely replace the agent's base configuration and are available for the following fields:

- System prompt
- First message
- Language
- Voice

## Overview

Overrides allow you to modify your AI agent's behavior in real-time without creating multiple agents. This enables you to personalize responses with user-specific data.

Here are a few examples where overrides can be useful:

- **Greet users** by their name
- **Include account-specific details** in responses
- **Adjust the agent's language** or tone based on user preferences
- **Pass real-time data** like account balances or order status

See the [WebSocket reference](/docs/conversational-ai/api-reference/conversational-ai/websocket) for all available messages and options.

<Info>
  Overrides are particularly useful for applications requiring personalized interactions or handling
  sensitive user data that shouldn't be stored in the agent's base configuration.

## Guide

### Prerequisites

- An [ElevenLabs account](https://elevenlabs.io)
- A configured ElevenLabs Conversational Agent ([create one here](/docs/conversational-ai/quickstart))

This guide will show you how to override the default agent **System prompt** & **First message**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable overrides">
    For security reasons, overrides are disabled by default. Navigate to your agent's settings and
    select the **Security** tab. 
    
    Enable the `First message` and `System prompt` overrides.

    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Override the conversation">
    In your code, where the conversation is started, pass the overrides as a parameter.

    <Tip>
      Ensure you have the latest [SDK](/docs/conversational-ai/libraries) installed.
