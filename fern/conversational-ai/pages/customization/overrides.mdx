title: Overrides
subtitle: Tailor each conversation with personalized context for each user.

<Warning>
  While overrides are still supported for completely replacing system prompts or first messages, we
  recommend using [Dynamic
  Variables](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/personalization/dynamic-variables) as the
  preferred way to customize your agent's responses and inject real-time data. Dynamic Variables
  offer better maintainability and a more structured approach to personalization.
</Warning>

**Overrides** enable your assistant to adapt its behavior for each user interaction. You can pass custom data and settings at the start of each conversation, allowing the assistant to personalize its responses and knowledge with real-time context. Overrides completely override the agent's default values defined in the agent's [dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/agents).

## Overview

Overrides allow you to modify your AI agent's behavior in real-time without creating multiple agents. This enables you to personalize responses with user-specific data.

Overrides can be enabled for the following fields in the agent's security settings:

- System prompt
- First message
- Language
- Voice ID

When overrides are enabled for a field, providing an override is still optional. If not provided, the agent will use the default values defined in the agent's [dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/agents). An error will be thrown if an override is provided for a field that does not have overrides enabled.

Here are a few examples where overrides can be useful:

- **Greet users** by their name
- **Include account-specific details** in responses
- **Adjust the agent's language** or tone based on user preferences
- **Pass real-time data** like account balances or order status

<Info>
  Overrides are particularly useful for applications requiring personalized interactions or handling
  sensitive user data that shouldn't be stored in the agent's base configuration.

## Guide

### Prerequisites

- An [ElevenLabs account](https://elevenlabs.io)
- A configured ElevenLabs Conversational Agent ([create one here](/docs/conversational-ai/quickstart))

This guide will show you how to override the default agent **System prompt** & **First message**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable overrides">
    For security reasons, overrides are disabled by default. Navigate to your agent's settings and
    select the **Security** tab. 
    
    Enable the `First message` and `System prompt` overrides.

    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Override the conversation">
    In your code, where the conversation is started, pass the overrides as a parameter.

    <Tip>
      Ensure you have the latest [SDK](/docs/conversational-ai/libraries) installed.

    <Note>
      When using overrides, omit any fields you don't want to override rather than setting them to empty strings or null values. Only include the fields you specifically want to customize.
