subtitle: Enhance your conversational agent with custom knowledge.

**Knowledge bases** allow you to equip your agent with relevant, domain-specific information.

## Overview

A well-curated knowledge base helps your agent go beyond its pre-trained data and deliver context-aware answers.

Here are a few examples where knowledge bases can be useful:

- **Product catalogs**: Store product specifications, pricing, and other essential details.
- **HR or corporate policies**: Provide quick answers about vacation policies, employee benefits, or onboarding procedures.
- **Technical documentation**: Equip your agent with in-depth guides or API references to assist developers.
- **Customer FAQs**: Answer common inquiries consistently.

<Info>
  The agent on this page is configured with full knowledge of ElevenLabs' documentation and sitemap. Go ahead and ask it about anything about ElevenLabs.

      linked to from the initial URL, or continuously updating the knowledge base over time.
      However, these features are coming soon.

## Best practices

<h4>Content quality</h4>

Provide clear, well-structured information that's relevant to your agent's purpose.

<h4>Size management</h4>

Break large documents into smaller, focused pieces for better processing.

<h4>Regular updates</h4>

Regularly review and update the agent's knowledge base to ensure the information remains current and accurate.

<h4>Identify knowledge gaps</h4>

Review conversation transcripts to identify popular topics, queries and areas where users struggle to find information. Note any knowledge gaps and add the missing context to the knowledge base.

## Enterprise features

Non-enterprise accounts have a limit of 5 knowledge base items, with a maximum of 20MB or 300k characters.
