subtitle: Enhance your conversational agent with custom knowledge.

**Knowledge bases** allow you to equip your agent with relevant, domain-specific information.

## Overview

A well-curated knowledge base helps your agent go beyond its pre-trained data and deliver context-aware answers.

Here are a few examples where knowledge bases can be useful:

- **Product catalogs**: Store product specifications, pricing, and other essential details.
- **HR or corporate policies**: Provide quick answers about vacation policies, employee benefits, or onboarding procedures.
- **Technical documentation**: Equip your agent with in-depth guides or API references to assist developers.
- **Customer FAQs**: Answer common inquiries consistently.

<Info>
  The agent on this page is configured with full knowledge of ElevenLabs' documentation and sitemap. Go ahead and ask it about anything about ElevenLabs.

      However, these features are coming soon.

## Best practices

<h4>Content quality</h4>

Provide clear, well-structured information that's relevant to your agent's purpose.

<h4>Size management</h4>

Break large documents into smaller, focused pieces for better processing.

<h4>Regular updates</h4>

Regularly review and update the agent's knowledge base to ensure the information remains current and accurate.

<h4>Identify knowledge gaps</h4>

Review conversation transcripts to identify popular topics, queries and areas where users struggle to find information. Note any knowledge gaps and add the missing context to the knowledge base.
