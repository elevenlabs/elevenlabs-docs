## Overview

When receiving inbound Twilio calls, you can dynamically fetch conversation initiation data through a webhook. This allows you to customize your agent's behavior based on caller information and other contextual data.

## How it works

1. When a Twilio call is received, the ElevenLabs Conversational AI platform will make a webhook call to your specified endpoint, passing call information (`caller_id`, `agent_id`, `called_number`, `call_sid`) as arguments
2. Your webhook returns conversation initiation client data, including dynamic variables and overrides (an example is shown below)
3. This data is used to initiate the conversation

<Tip>

The system uses Twilio's connection/dialing period to fetch webhook data in parallel, creating a
seamless experience where:

- Users hear the expected telephone connection sound
- In parallel, theConversational AI platform fetches necessary webhook data
- The conversation is initiated with the fetched data by the time the audio connection is established

</Tip>

## Configuration

<Steps>

  <Step title="Configure webhook details">
    In the [settings page](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/settings) of the Conversational AI platform, configure the webhook URL and add any
    secrets needed for authentication.

    </Frame>

    Click on the webhook to modify which secrets are sent in the headers.

    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable fetching conversation initiation data">
    In the "Security" tab of the [agent's page](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/agents/), enable fetching conversation initiation data for inbound Twilio calls, and define fields that can be overridden.

    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Implement the webhook endpoint to receive Twilio data">
    The webhook will receive a POST request with the following parameters:

    | Parameter       | Type   | Description                            |
    | --------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
    | `caller_id`     | string | The phone number of the caller         |
    | `agent_id`      | string | The ID of the agent receiving the call |
    | `called_number` | string | The Twilio number that was called      |
    | `call_sid`      | string | Unique identifier for the Twilio call  |

  </Step>

  <Step title="Return conversation initiation client data">
   Your webhook must return a JSON response containing the initiation data for the agent.
  <Info>
    The `dynamic_variables` field must contain all dynamic variables defined for the agent. Overrides
    on the other hand are entirely optional. For more information about dynamic variables and
    overrides see the [dynamic variables](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/personalization/dynamic-variables) and
    [overrides](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/personalization/overrides) docs.
  </Info>

An example response could be:

```json
{
  "type": "conversation_initiation_client_data",
  "dynamic_variables": {
    "customer_name": "John Doe",
    "account_status": "premium",
    "last_interaction": "2024-01-15"
  },
  "conversation_config_override": {
    "agent": {
      "prompt": {
        "prompt": "The customer's bank account balance is $100. They are based in San Francisco."
      },
      "first_message": "Hi, how can I help you today?",
      "language": "en"
    },
    "tts": {
      "voice_id": "new-voice-id"
    }
  }
}
```

  </Step>
</Steps>

The Conversational AI platform will use the dynamic variables to populate the conversation initiation data, and the conversation will start smoothly.

<Warning>
  Ensure your webhook responds within a reasonable timeout period to avoid delaying the call
  handling.
</Warning>

## Security

- Use HTTPS endpoints only
- Implement authentication using request headers
- Store sensitive values as secrets through the [ElevenLabs secrets manager](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/settings)
- Validate the incoming request parameters
