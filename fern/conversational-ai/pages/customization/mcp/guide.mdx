subtitle: Connect your ElevenLabs conversational agents to external tools and data sources using the Model Context Protocol.
---

## Overview

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that defines how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). Think of MCP as a universal connector, enabling AI models to seamlessly interact with diverse data sources and tools. By integrating servers that implement MCP, you can significantly extend the capabilities of your ElevenLabs conversational agents.

<Note>
  MCP support is not currently available for users on Zero Retention Mode and those requiring HIPAA
  compliance.
</Note>

ElevenLabs allows you to connect your conversational agents to external MCP servers. This enables your agents to:

- Access and process information from various data sources via the MCP server.
- Utilize specialized tools and functionalities exposed by the MCP server.
- Create more dynamic, knowledgeable, and interactive conversational experiences.

## How MCP integration works with ElevenLabs

1.  **Register MCP Server**: In your ElevenLabs workspace, register an external MCP server by providing its URL and any necessary authentication details.
2.  **Tool Discovery**: ElevenLabs interacts with the registered MCP server to discover the tools and resources it offers, as defined by the MCP specification.
3.  **Agent Configuration**: When building or configuring a conversational agent in ElevenLabs, select which registered MCP servers (and consequently, their tools) the agent can utilize.
4.  **Runtime Interaction**: During a conversation, your ElevenLabs agent can invoke tools on the connected MCP server. The LLM controlling the agent decides when and how to use these tools based on the conversation's context and the tool descriptions provided by the MCP server.

## Key considerations for ElevenLabs integration

- **External Servers**: You are responsible for selecting the external MCP servers you wish to integrate. ElevenLabs provides the means to connect to them.
- **Supported Features**: ElevenLabs currently supports MCP servers that communicate over SSE (Server-Sent Events) for real-time interactions.
- **Dynamic Tools**: The tools and capabilities available from an integrated MCP server are defined by that external server and can change if the server's configuration is updated.

## Security and disclaimer

Integrating external MCP servers can expose your agents and data to third-party services. It is crucial to understand the security implications.

<Warning title="Important Disclaimer">
  By enabling MCP server integrations, you acknowledge that this may involve data sharing with
  third-party services not controlled by ElevenLabs. This could incur additional security risks.
  Please ensure you fully understand the implications, vet the security of any MCP server you
  integrate, and review our [MCP Integration Security
  Guidelines](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/mcp/security) before proceeding.
</Warning>

Refer to our [MCP Integration Security Guidelines](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/mcp/security) for detailed best practices.

## Finding or building MCP servers

To use this feature, you'll need access to an MCP server. You can:

- Utilize publicly available MCP servers from trusted providers.
- Develop your own MCP server to expose your proprietary data or tools.
- Explore the Model Context Protocol community and resources for examples and server implementations.
