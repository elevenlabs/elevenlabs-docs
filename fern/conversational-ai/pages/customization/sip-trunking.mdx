title: SIP Trunking
subtitle: Connect your existing phone system with ElevenLabs conversational AI agents using SIP trunking
---

## Overview

SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) trunking allows you to connect your existing telephony infrastructure directly to ElevenLabs conversational AI agents. This integration enables enterprise customers to use their existing phone systems while leveraging ElevenLabs' advanced voice AI capabilities.

With SIP trunking, you can:

- Connect your PBX or SIP-enabled phone system to ElevenLabs' voice AI platform
- Route calls to AI agents without changing your existing phone infrastructure
- Maintain your current phone numbers while adding AI capabilities
- Handle both inbound and outbound call scenarios

## How SIP Trunking Works

SIP trunking establishes a direct connection between your telephony infrastructure and the ElevenLabs platform:

1. **Inbound Calls**: Calls from your SIP trunk are routed to the ElevenLabs platform using the provided origination URI.
2. **Outbound Calls**: ElevenLabs routes calls back to your system using your configured termination URI.
3. **Authentication**: Connection security is maintained through either digest authentication (username/password) or ACL (Access Control List) authentication.

## Requirements

Before setting up SIP trunking, ensure you have:

1. A SIP-compatible PBX or telephony system
2. Phone numbers that you want to connect to ElevenLabs
3. Administrator access to your SIP trunk configuration
4. Appropriate firewall settings to allow SIP traffic

## Setting Up SIP Trunking

<Steps>
  ### Navigate to Phone Numbers
  Go to Conversational AI â†’ Phone Numbers in the ElevenLabs dashboard.

### Import SIP Trunk

Click on "Import a phone number from SIP trunk" button to open the configuration dialog.

### Enter Configuration Details

Complete the form with the following information:

- **Label**: A descriptive name for the phone number
- **Phone Number**: The E.164 formatted phone number to connect (e.g., +15551234567)
- **Termination URI**: Your SIP trunk's termination URI (where ElevenLabs will send outbound calls)

### Configure Authentication (Optional)

If your SIP provider requires digest authentication:

- Enter the username for SIP digest authentication
- Enter the password for SIP digest authentication

If left empty, ACL authentication will be used (you'll need to allowlist ElevenLabs IPs in your provider's settings).

### Complete Setup

Click "Import" to finalize the configuration.

</Steps>

## Inbound Configuration

For inbound calls (calls coming from your system to ElevenLabs), you'll need to configure your SIP trunk to route calls to the ElevenLabs origination URI:
`sip:sip.rtc.eleven2.dev:5060;transport=tcp`

This URI is automatically populated and cannot be modified as it's the endpoint your system must use to reach ElevenLabs.

## Outbound Configuration

For outbound calls (calls from ElevenLabs back to your system), you need to provide:

- **Termination URI**: The SIP URI where ElevenLabs should send calls for your phone number (e.g., `sip:your-sip-trunk-uri`)
- **Authentication Credentials** (Optional): If your SIP trunk requires digest authentication, provide the username and password. Otherwise, ACL authentication will be used.

## Authentication Methods

ElevenLabs supports two authentication methods for SIP trunking:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Digest Authentication">
    Provide a username and password when configuring your SIP trunk in ElevenLabs. This method is
    more secure and simpler to set up. ``` Username: your-sip-username Password: your-sip-password
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="ACL Authentication">
    If you don't provide authentication credentials, you'll need to allowlist ElevenLabs' IP
    addresses in your SIP trunk provider's settings. Contact ElevenLabs support for the current list
    of IP addresses to allowlist.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Assigning Agents to Phone Numbers

After importing your SIP trunk phone number, you can assign it to a conversational AI agent:

1. Go to the Phone Numbers section in the Conversational AI dashboard
2. Select your imported SIP trunk phone number
3. Click "Assign Agent"
4. Select the agent you want to handle calls to this number

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection Issues">
    If you're experiencing connection problems: 1. Verify your SIP trunk configuration on both the
    ElevenLabs side and your provider side 2. Check that your firewall allows SIP traffic on port
    5060 3. Confirm that your termination URI is correctly formatted 4. Test with and without
    authentication credentials
  </Accordion>

{' '}
<Accordion title="Authentication Failures">
  If calls are failing due to authentication issues: 1. Double-check your username and password if
  using digest authentication 2. Verify that ElevenLabs' IP addresses are allowlisted if using ACL
  authentication 3. Check your SIP trunk provider's logs for specific authentication error messages
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Audio Quality Issues">
    If you experience poor audio quality: 1. Ensure your network has sufficient bandwidth (at least
    100 Kbps per call) 2. Check for network congestion or packet loss 3. Verify that your SIP trunk
    provider supports high-quality codecs

## Limitations and Considerations

- SIP trunking is currently available only to enterprise customers
- Support for multiple concurrent calls depends on your subscription tier
- Call recording and analytics features are available but may require additional configuration
- Outbound calling capabilities may be limited by your SIP trunk provider
