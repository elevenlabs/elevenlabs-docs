## Retention

Retention settings control the duration for which conversation transcripts and audio recordings are stored.

For detailed instructions, see our [Retention](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/privacy/retention) page.

## Audio Saving

Audio Saving settings determine if call audio recordings are stored. Adjust this feature based on your privacy and data retention needs.

For detailed instructions, see our [Audio Saving](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/privacy/audio-saving) page.

## Zero Retention Mode (Per Agent)

For granular control, Zero Retention Mode can be enabled for individual agents, ensuring no PII is logged or stored for their calls.

For detailed instructions, see our [Zero Retention Mode](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/privacy/zero-retention-mode) page.

## Recommended Privacy Configurations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Maximum Privacy">
    Disable audio saving, enable Zero Retention Mode for agents where possible, and set retention to
    0 days for immediate deletion of data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Balanced Privacy">
    Enable audio saving for critical interactions while setting a moderate retention period.
    Consider ZRM for sensitive agents.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Compliance Focus">
    Enable audio saving and configure retention settings to adhere to regulatory requirements such
    as GDPR and HIPAA. For HIPAA compliance, we recommend enabling audio saving and setting a
    retention period of at least 6 years. For GDPR, retention periods should align with your data
    processing purposes. Utilize ZRM for agents handling highly sensitive data if not using global
    ZRM.
