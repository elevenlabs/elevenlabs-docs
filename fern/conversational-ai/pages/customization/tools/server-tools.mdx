subtitle: Connect your assistant to external data & systems.

**Tools** enable your assistant to connect to external data and systems. You can define a set of tools that the assistant has access to, and the assistant will use them where appropriate based on the conversation.

## Overview

Many applications require assistants to call external APIs to get real-time information. Tools give your assistant the ability to make external function calls to third party apps so you can get real-time information.

Here are a few examples where tools can be useful:

- **Fetching data**: enable an assistant to retrieve real-time data from any REST-enabled database or 3rd party integration before responding to the user.
- **Taking action**: allow an assistant to trigger authenticated actions based on the conversation, like scheduling meetings or initiating order returns.

<Info>
  To interact with Application UIs or trigger client-side events use [client
  tools](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools/client-tools) instead.
</Info>

## Tool configuration

Conversational AI assistants can be equipped with tools to interact with external APIs. Unlike traditional requests, the assistant generates query, body, and path parameters dynamically based on the conversation and parameter descriptions you provide.

All tool configurations and parameter descriptions help the assistant determine **when** and **how** to use these tools. To orchestrate tool usage effectively, update the assistant’s system prompt to specify the sequence and logic for making these calls. This includes:

- **Which tool** to use and under what conditions.
- **What parameters** the tool needs to function properly.
- **How to handle** the responses.

<Tab title="Configuration">
Define a high-level `Name` and `Description` to describe the tool's purpose. This helps the LLM understand the tool and know when to call it.

<Info>
  If the API requires path parameters, include variables in the URL path by wrapping them in curly
  braces `{}`, for example: `/api/resource/{id}` where `id` is a path parameter.

## Guide

In this guide, we'll create a weather assistant that can provide real-time weather information for any location. The assistant will use its geographic knowledge to convert location names into coordinates and fetch accurate weather data.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure the weather tool">
    First, on the **Agent** section of your agent settings page, choose **Add Tool**. Select **Webhook** as the Tool Type, then configure the weather API integration:

    <Warning>
      An API key is not required for this tool. If one is required, this should be passed in the headers and stored as a secret.
    </Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Orchestration">
    Configure your assistant to handle weather queries intelligently with this system prompt:

    ```plaintext System prompt
    You are a helpful conversational AI assistant with access to a weather tool. When users ask about
    weather conditions, use the get_weather tool to fetch accurate, real-time data. The tool requires
    a latitude and longitude - use your geographic knowledge to convert location names to coordinates
    accurately.

    Never ask users for coordinates - you must determine these yourself. Always report weather
    information conversationally, referring to locations by name only. For weather requests:

    1. Extract the location from the user's message
    2. Convert the location to coordinates and call get_weather
    3. Present the information naturally and helpfully

    For non-weather queries, provide friendly assistance within your knowledge boundaries. Always be
    concise, accurate, and helpful.

    First message: "Hey, how can I help you today?"
    ```

    <Success>
      Test your assistant by asking about the weather in different locations. The assistant should
      handle specific locations ("What's the weather in Tokyo?") and ask for clarification after general queries ("How's
      the weather looking today?").
    </Success>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported Authentication Methods

Conversational AI supports multiple authentication methods to securely connect your tools with external APIs. Authentication methods are configured in your agent settings and then connected to individual tools as needed.

<Frame background="subtle">
  ![Workspace Auth Connection](/assets/images/conversational-ai/workspace-auth-connection.png)
</Frame>

Once configured, you can connect these authentication methods to your tools and manage custom headers in the tool configuration:

<Frame background="subtle">
  ![Tool Auth Connection](/assets/images/conversational-ai/tool-auth-config.png)
</Frame>

#### OAuth2 Client Credentials

Automatically handles the OAuth2 client credentials flow. Configure with your client ID, client secret, and token URL (e.g., `https://api.example.com/oauth/token`). Optionally specify scopes as comma-separated values and additional JSON parameters. Set up by clicking **Add Auth** on **Workspace Auth Connections** on the **Agent** section of your agent settings page.

#### OAuth2 JWT

Uses JSON Web Token authentication for OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer flow. Requires your JWT signing secret, token URL, and algorithm (default: HS256). Configure JWT claims including issuer, audience, and subject. Optionally set key ID, expiration (default: 3600 seconds), scopes, and extra parameters. Set up by clicking **Add Auth** on **Workspace Auth Connections** on the **Agent** section of your agent settings page.

#### Basic Authentication

Simple username and password authentication for APIs that support HTTP Basic Auth. Set up by clicking **Add Auth** on **Workspace Auth Connections** in the **Agent** section of your agent settings page.

#### Bearer Tokens

Token-based authentication that adds your bearer token value to the request header. Configure by adding a header to the tool configuration, selecting **Secret** as the header type, and clicking **Create New Secret**.

#### Custom Headers

Add custom authentication headers with any name and value for proprietary authentication methods. Configure by adding a header to the tool configuration and specifying its **name** and **value**.
