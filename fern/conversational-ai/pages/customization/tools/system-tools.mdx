title: System tools
subtitle: Update the internal state of conversations without external requests.
---

**System tools** enable your assistant to update the internal state of a conversation. Unlike [server tools](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools-events/server-tools) or [client tools](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools-events/client-tools), system tools don't make external API calls or trigger client-side functionsâ€”they modify the internal state of the conversation without making external calls.

## Overview

Some applications require agents to control the flow or state of a conversation.
System tools provide this capability by allowing the assistant to perform actions related to the state of the call that don't require communicating with external servers or the client.
