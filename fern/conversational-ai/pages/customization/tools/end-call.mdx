## Overview

The **End Call** tool allows your conversational agent to terminate a call with the user. This is a system tool that is enabled by default, providing flexibility in how and when calls are ended.

## Functionality

- **Default behavior**: The tool can operate without any user-defined prompts, ending the call when the conversation naturally concludes.
- **Custom prompts**: Users can specify conditions under which the call should end. For example:
  - End the call if the user says "goodbye."
  - Conclude the call when a specific task is completed.

## Example prompts

**Example 1**

```
If the user says 'end call', terminate the session.
```

**Example 2**

```
Once the user confirms their order, end the call.
```
