<Note>
  The **End Call** tool is added to agents created in the UI by default. For agents created via
  API/SDK, you must add it manually as a system tool in your agent configuration. See the [Create
  Agent API Reference](https://api.elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/operations/create-agent) for
  implementation details.

## Overview

The **End Call** tool allows your conversational agent to terminate a call with the user. This is a system tool that provides flexibility in how and when calls are ended.

## Functionality

- **Default behavior**: The tool can operate without any user-defined prompts, ending the call when the conversation naturally concludes.
- **Custom prompts**: Users can specify conditions under which the call should end. For example:
  - End the call if the user says "goodbye."
  - Conclude the call when a specific task is completed.

### API Implementation

When creating an agent via API, add the End Call tool to your agent configuration:

<CodeBlocks>
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/agents/create \
     -H "xi-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
  "conversation_config": {
    "agent": {
      "prompt": {
        "tools": [
          {
            "type": "system",
            "name": "end_call",
            "description": ""
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}'
```
</CodeBlocks>

If the description is left blank, the tool will be triggered according to a default prompt provided by ElevenLabs.

## Example prompts

**Example 1**

```
If the user says 'end call', terminate the session.
```

**Example 2**

```
Once the user confirms their order, end the call.
```
