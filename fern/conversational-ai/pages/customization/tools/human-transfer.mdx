title: Transfer to human
subtitle: Seamlessly transfer the user to a human operator via phone number based on defined conditions.
---

## Overview

Human transfer allows a Conversational AI agent to transfer the ongoing call to a specified phone number when certain conditions are met. This enables agents to hand off complex issues, specific requests, or situations requiring human intervention to a live operator.

This feature utilizes the `transfer_to_number` system tool and currently supports transfers via Twilio. When triggered, the agent can provide a message to the user while they wait and a separate message summarizing the situation for the human operator receiving the call.

<Info>
  This feature currently requires a configured native Twilio integration for the phone number
  receiving the transfer.

## Enabling human transfer

Human transfer is configured using the `transfer_to_number` system tool.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Add the transfer tool">
        Enable human transfer by selecting the `transfer_to_number` system tool in your agent's configuration within the `Agent` tab. Choose "Transfer to Human" when adding a tool.

        </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure tool description (optional)">
        You can provide a custom description to guide the LLM on when to trigger a transfer. If left blank, a default description encompassing the defined transfer rules will be used.

             <img src="/assets/images/conversational-ai/transfer_human_tool.png" alt="Human Transfer Tool Description" />
        </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Define transfer rules">
        Configure the specific rules for transferring to phone numbers. For each rule, specify:
        - **Phone Number**: The target phone number in E.164 format (e.g., +12125551234) to transfer the call to.
        - **Condition**: A natural language description of the circumstances under which the transfer should occur (e.g., "User explicitly requests to speak to a human", "User needs to update sensitive account information").

        The LLM will use these conditions, along with the tool description, to decide when and to which phone number to transfer.

        </Frame>

        <Note>
            Ensure the phone number is correctly formatted (E.164) and associated with a properly configured Twilio account capable of receiving calls.
        </Note>
    </Step>

## API Implementation

You can configure the `transfer_to_number` system tool when creating or updating an agent via the API. The tool allows specifying messages for both the client (user being transferred) and the agent (human operator receiving the call).

<CodeBlocks>

```python
from elevenlabs import (
    ConversationalConfig,
    ElevenLabs,
    AgentConfig,
    PromptAgent,
    PromptAgentInputToolsItem_System,
    SystemToolConfigInputParams_TransferToNumber,
    PhoneNumberTransfer,
)

# Initialize the client
client = ElevenLabs(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Define transfer rules
transfer_rules = [
    PhoneNumberTransfer(phone_number="+15551234567", condition="When the user asks for billing support."),
    PhoneNumberTransfer(phone_number="+15559876543", condition="When the user requests to file a formal complaint.")
]

# Create the transfer tool configuration
transfer_tool = PromptAgentInputToolsItem_System(
    type="system",
    name="transfer_to_human",
    description="Transfer the user to a specialized agent based on their request.", # Optional custom description
    params=SystemToolConfigInputParams_TransferToNumber(
        transfers=transfer_rules
    )
)

# Create the agent configuration
conversation_config = ConversationalConfig(
    agent=AgentConfig(
        prompt=PromptAgent(
            prompt="You are a helpful assistant.",
            first_message="Hi, how can I help you today?",
            tools=[transfer_tool],
        )
    )
)

# Create the agent
response = client.conversational_ai.create_agent(
    conversation_config=conversation_config
)

# Note: When the LLM decides to call this tool, it needs to provide:
# - transfer_number: The phone number to transfer to (must match one defined in rules).
# - client_message: Message read to the user during transfer.
# - agent_message: Message read to the human operator receiving the call.
```

```javascript
import { ElevenLabs } from 'elevenlabs';

// Initialize the client
const client = new ElevenLabs({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
});

// Define transfer rules
const transferRules = [
  { phone_number: '+15551234567', condition: 'When the user asks for billing support.' },
  { phone_number: '+15559876543', condition: 'When the user requests to file a formal complaint.' },
];

// Create the agent with the transfer tool
await client.conversationalAi.createAgent({
  conversation_config: {
    agent: {
      prompt: {
        prompt: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
        first_message: 'Hi, how can I help you today?',
        tools: [
          {
            type: 'system',
            name: 'transfer_to_number',
            description: 'Transfer the user to a human operator based on their request.', // Optional custom description
            params: {
              system_tool_type: 'transfer_to_number',
              transfers: transferRules,
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
});

// Note: When the LLM decides to call this tool, it needs to provide:
// - transfer_number: The phone number to transfer to (must match one defined in rules).
// - client_message: Message read to the user during transfer.
// - agent_message: Message read to the human operator receiving the call.
