title: Agent tools deprecation
subtitle: Migrate from legacy `prompt.tools` to the new `prompt.tool_ids` field.
---

## Overview

<Info>The way you wire tools into your ConvAI agents is getting a refresh.</Info>

### What's changing?

- The old request field `body.conversation_config.agent.prompt.tools` is **deprecated**.
- Use `body.conversation_config.agent.prompt.tool_ids` to list the IDs of the client or server tools your agent should use.
- **New field** `prompt.built_in_tools` is introduced for **system tools** (e.g., `end_call`, `language_detection`). These tools are referenced by **name**, not by ID.

### Critical deadlines

<Check>
  **July 14, 2025** - Last day for full backwards compatibility. You can continue using
  `prompt.tools` until this date.
</Check>

<Note>
  **July 15, 2025** - GET endpoints will stop returning the `tools` field. Only `prompt.tool_ids`
  will be included in responses.
</Note>

<Warning>
  **July 23, 2025** - Legacy `prompt.tools` field will be permanently removed. All requests
  containing this field will be rejected.
</Warning>

## Why the change?

Decoupling tools from agents brings several advantages:

- **Re-use** – the same tool can be shared across multiple agents.
- **Simpler audits** – inspect, update or delete a tool in one place.
- **Cleaner payloads** – agent configurations stay lightweight.

## What has already happened?

<Check>
  Good news — we've already migrated your data! Every tool that previously lived in `prompt.tools`
  now exists as a standalone record, and its ID is present in the agent's `prompt.tool_ids` array.
  No scripts required.
</Check>

We have **automatically migrated all existing data**:

- Every tool that was previously in an agent's `prompt.tools` array now exists as a standalone record.
- The agent's `prompt.tool_ids` array already references those new tool records.

No one-off scripts are required — your agents continue to work unchanged.

## Deprecation timeline

| Date              | Status                   | Behaviour                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **July 14, 2025** | ✅ Full compatibility    | You may keep sending `prompt.tools`. GET responses include the `tools` field.    |
| **July 15, 2025** | ⚠️ Partial compatibility | GET endpoints stop returning the `tools` field. Only `prompt.tool_ids` included. |
| **July 23, 2025** | ❌ No compatibility      | POST and PATCH endpoints **reject** any request containing `prompt.tools`.       |

## Toolbox endpoint

All tool management lives under a dedicated endpoint:

```http title="Tool management"
POST | GET | PATCH | DELETE  https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/tools
```

Use it to:

- **Create** a tool and obtain its ID.
- **Update** it when requirements change.
- **Delete** it when it is no longer needed.

Anything that once sat in the old `tools` array now belongs here.

## Migration guide

<Error>
  System tools are **not** supported in `prompt.tool_ids`. Instead, specify them in the **new**
  `prompt.built_in_tools` field.
</Error>

If you are still using the legacy field, follow the steps below.

<Steps>
  ### 1. Stop sending `prompt.tools`
  Remove the `tools` array from your agent configuration.

### 2. Send the tool IDs instead

Replace it with `prompt.tool_ids`, containing the IDs of the client or server tools the agent
should use.

### 3. (Optional) Clean up

After 23 July, delete any unused standalone tools via the toolbox endpoint.

</Steps>

## Example payloads

<Note>
  A request must include **either** `prompt.tool_ids` **or** the legacy `prompt.tools` array —
  **never both**. Sending both fields results in an error.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will my existing integrations break?">
    No. Until July 23, the API will silently migrate any `prompt.tools` array you send. However,
    starting July 15, GET and PATCH responses will no longer include full tool objects. After July
    23, any POST/PATCH requests containing `prompt.tools` will be rejected.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I mix both fields in one request?">
    No. A request must use **either** `prompt.tool_ids` **or** `prompt.tools` — never both.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I find a tool's ID?">
    List your tools via `GET /v1/convai/tools` or inspect the response when you create one.
