In this guide, you'll learn how to create your first Conversational AI voice agent. This will serve as a foundation for building conversational workflows tailored to your business use cases.

## Getting started

Conversational AI agents are managed through the [ElevenLabs dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai). This is used to:

- Create and manage AI assistants
- Configure voice settings and conversation parameters
- Equip the agent with [tools](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools) and a [knowledge base](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/knowledge-base)
- Review conversation analytics and transcripts
- Manage API keys and integration settings

<Note>
  The web dashboard uses our [Web SDK](/docs/conversational-ai/libraries/react) under the hood to
  handle real-time conversations.
