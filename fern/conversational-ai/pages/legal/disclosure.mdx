Your use of ElevenLabs Conversational AI is subject to our [Conversational AI Terms](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai-terms). As outlined in those Terms, you are required to provide clear notice to your end users that:

- They are interacting with AI rather than a human
- Their conversations are being recorded and may be shared with ElevenLabs and its third-party large language model providers

## Implementation

This disclosure must be presented immediately prior to any interaction with the Conversational AI feature. Common implementation methods include:

- A separate screen or interstitial page
- A pop-up notice
- A persistent banner

<Warning>
  Users must not be able to access or use the feature without first being presented with this
  notice.

In addition to satisfying our contractual requirements, this approach promotes transparency and builds trust by ensuring users understand the nature of the interaction.
