## Overview

ElevenLabs is committed to robust data protection and compliance with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For organizations operating in the EEA or Switzerland, ElevenLabs offers European data residency as a feature for Enterprise customers. This allows businesses to leverage our advanced voice AI technology while ensuring that their data is processed and stored in compliance with local data sovereignty requirements limiting the processing of data outside of the EEA.

<Note>
  With EU residency enabled, Gemini and Claude LLMs, as well as custom LLMs are available in
  Conversational AI. An agreement to use OpenAI models with EU data residency mode is pending.
</Note>

Enabling European data residency may also provide the benefit of reduced latency for users located in Europe due to localized data processing

<Note>
  European data residency is an Enterprise-specific feature. For details on enabling this for your
  organization, please see the "Getting Access" section below.

## Core Compliance Features

European data residency complements ElevenLabs' existing suite of security and compliance measures designed to safeguard customer data:

- **GDPR Compliance**: Our platform and practices are designed to align with GDPR principles, including measures designed to ensure lawful data processing, adherence to data subject rights, and the implementation of appropriate security measures.
- **SOC2 Certification**: ElevenLabs maintains SOC2 certification, demonstrating our commitment to high standards for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.
- **Zero Retention Mode (Optional)**: Customers can enable Zero Retention Mode, ensuring that sensitive content and data processed by our models are not retained on ElevenLabs servers. This is a powerful feature for minimizing data footprint.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Data transmitted to and from ElevenLabs models is protected by end-to-end encryption, securing it in transit.
- **HIPAA Compliance**: For qualifying healthcare enterprises, ElevenLabs offers Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) and HIPAA-compliant configurations for its HIPAA-eligible services.

## How European Data Residency Works

When European data residency is enabled for an Enterprise account:

1.  **Data Localization**: Relevant customer data associated with the use of our voice AI services is processed and stored within data centers located in the European Union.
2.  **Compliance with Sovereignty**: This localization is designed to help organizations meet regional data sovereignty mandates and regulatory obligations.
3.  **Standard Functionality**: European data residency operates seamlessly with ElevenLabs' core platform features, ensuring you receive the same high-quality AI audio generation and capabilities.

<Info>
  In some instances, data may nevertheless be processed outside of the EEA or Switzerland. The
  specific scope of data covered by European data residency will be detailed in your Enterprise
  agreement. Configuration of this feature is managed at the organizational level by ElevenLabs.

## Getting Access

European data residency is an exclusive feature available to ElevenLabs Enterprise customers.

- **Existing Enterprise Customers**: If you are an existing Enterprise customer, please contact your dedicated Customer Success Manager or reach out to our support team to discuss enabling European data residency for your account.
- **New Customers**: Organizations interested in ElevenLabs Enterprise and requiring European data residency should [contact our sales team](https://elevenlabs.io/contact-sales) to discuss specific needs and implementation.

## Developer Considerations

For developers, the implementation of European data residency is primarily a back-end configuration managed by ElevenLabs for your Enterprise account.

- **API Endpoints**: Standard API endpoints and integration methods remain the same. Your application code typically does not require changes to benefit from European data residency once enabled for your account.
- **Data Handling**: While ElevenLabs manages the residency of data on our servers in accordance with your Enterprise agreement, developers should continue to adhere to best practices for data handling and GDPR compliance within their own applications and systems. This includes aspects like obtaining user consent, managing data subject rights requests, and ensuring data minimization.
- **Zero Retention Mode**: Consider using Zero Retention Mode in conjunction with European data residency if minimizing data storage on ElevenLabs servers is a critical requirement for your use case.
