<Warning>
  This guide is a technical overview of our HIPAA compliance. Please refer to our [compliance
  page](https://compliance.elevenlabs.io/) for the latest information.
</Warning>

## Overview

ElevenLabs Conversational AI is one of ElevenLabs’ HIPAA-eligible services, and we offer Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) to eligible customers. This service enables Covered Entities and Business Associates, as defined under HIPAA, to develop AI-powered voice agents capable of handling Protected Health Information (PHI) while ensuring regulatory compliance.

Once a BAA is in place and Zero Retention Mode is enabled, PHI remains securely protected throughout the entire conversation lifecycle, ensuring full compliance with HIPAA’s data protection requirements.

## How HIPAA compliance works

When HIPAA compliance is required for a workspace, the following policies are enabled:

1. **Zero Retention Mode** - All sensitive data from conversations is automatically redacted before storage. This also applies to derivative data like LLM-produced transcript summaries, and tool call parameters and results.
2. **LLM Provider Restrictions** - Only LLM from providers with whom we have a BAA in place are available as preconfigured options
3. **Storage Limitations** - Raw audio files and transcripts containing PHI are not retained

<Note>

If you want to use LLMs that aren't available preconfigured in Zero Retention Mode (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4o mini), you
can still use them in Conversational AI by:

1. Arranging to sign a BAA directly with the LLM provider you'd like to use
2. Using your API key with our Custom LLM integration

</Note>

ElevenLabs' platform ensures that PHI shared as part of a conversation is not inadvertently stored or logged in any system component, including:

- Conversation transcripts
- Audio recordings
- Tool calls and results
- Data analytics
- System logs

<Warning>
  For Conversational AI, your BAA applies only to conversation content. Agent configuration data is
  persisted, meaning it is not covered by Zero Retention Mode and should not contain PHI.
</Warning>

### Enabling HIPAA compliance

<Note>
  HIPAA compliance is only available on Enterprise tier subscriptions and requires a BAA to be in
  place between you and ElevenLabs. Contact your account representative to discuss enabling this
  feature for your organization.

## HIPAA-Compliant LLMs

When operating in Zero Retention Mode, only the following LLMs are available:

    - [Custom LLM](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/llm/custom-llm) (supports any OpenAI-API compatible provider and requires you to bring your own API keys)
  </Accordion>
  
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical implementation

Zero Retention Mode implements several safeguards including but not limited to:

1. **LLM Allowlist** - Prevents use of non-compliant LLMs
2. **PII Redaction** - Automatically redacts sensitive fields before storage
3. **Storage Prevention** - Disables uploading of raw audio files to cloud

  </Step>
</Steps>

### API restrictions are enforced

API calls attempting to use non-compliant LLMs will receive an HTTP 400 error. Analytics data will be limited to non-sensitive metrics only.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use any LLM if HIPAA compliance is required?">
    No. When HIPAA compliance is required, you can only use LLMs from the approved list. Attempts to
    use non-compliant LLMs will produce an error. You can always use a custom LLM if you need a
    specific model not on the allowlist.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I know if my workspace is HIPAA compliant?">
    HIPAA compliance is only available to enterprise customers. Please refer to your account
    executive to check if this is enabled.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does HIPAA compliance affect conversation quality?">
    No. HIPAA compliance only affects how data is stored and which LLMs can be used. It does not
    impact the quality or functionality of conversations while they are active.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I still analyze conversation data if my agent is HIPAA compliant?">
    Yes, but with limitations. Conversation analytics will only include non-sensitive metadata like
    call duration and success rates. Specific content from conversations will be redacted.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best practices

When building HIPAA-compliant voice agents:

1. **Use Custom LLMs** when possible for maximum control over data processing
2. **Implement proper authentication** for all healthcare applications
3. **Validate configuration** is correct by checking redaction before launching + passing PHI
