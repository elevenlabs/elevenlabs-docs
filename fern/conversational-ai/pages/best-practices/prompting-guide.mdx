## Overview

Effective prompting transforms [Conversational AI](/docs/conversational-ai/overview) voice agents from robotic to lifelike. This guide outlines six core building blocks for designing agent prompts that create engaging, natural interactions across customer support, education, therapy, and other applications.

<Info>
  The difference between an AI-sounding and naturally expressive Conversational AI agent comes down
  to how well you structure its system prompt.
</Info>

## Six building blocks

It's best to keep each building block isolated for clarity. For example, the **Personality** section should focus strictly on the agent's human-like qualities (name, traits, and background). Meanwhile, **Environment** captures context, **Tone** governs style, and so on. This modular approach simplifies iteration and helps maintain a clean, purposeful prompt structure.

<Frame background="subtle">
  ![System prompt principles](/assets/images/conversational-ai/system-prompt-principles.png)
</Frame>

### 1. Personality

The base personality is the foundation of your voice agent's identity, defining who the agent is supposed to emulate through a name, role, background, and key traits. It ensures consistent, authentic responses in every interaction.

- **Identity:** Give your agent a simple, memorable name (e.g. "Joe") and establish the essential identity (e.g. "a compassionate AI support assistant").

- **Core traits:** List only the qualities that shape interactions-such as empathy, politeness, humor, or reliability.

- **Role:** Connect these traits to the agent's function (banking, therapy, retail, education, etc.). A banking bot might emphasize trustworthiness, while a tutor bot emphasizes thorough explanations.

- **Backstory:** Include a brief background if it impacts how the agent behaves (e.g. "trained therapist with years of experience in stress reduction"), but avoid irrelevant details.

<CodeBlocks>

```mdx title="Example: Expressive agent personality"
# Personality

You are Joe, a nurturing virtual wellness coach.
You speak calmly and empathetically, always validating the user's emotions.
You guide them toward mindfulness techniques or positive affirmations when needed.
You're naturally curious, empathetic, and intuitive, always aiming to deeply understand the user's intent by actively listening.
You thoughtfully refer back to details they've previously shared.
```

```mdx title="Example: Task-focused agent personality"
# Personality

You are Ava, a customer support agent for a telecom company.
You are friendly, solution-oriented, and efficient.
You address customers by name, politely guiding them toward a resolution.
```

</CodeBlocks>

### 2. Environment

The environment captures where, how, and under what conditions your agent interacts with the user. It establishes setting (physical or virtual), mode of communication (like phone call or website chat), and any situational factors.

- **State the medium**: Define the communication channel (e.g. "over the phone", "via smart speaker", "in a noisy environment"). This helps your agent adjust verbosity or repetition if the setting is loud or hands-free.

- **Include relevant context**: Inform your agent about the user's likely state. If the user is potentially stressed (such as calling tech support after an outage), mention it: "the customer might be frustrated due to service issues." This primes the agent to respond with empathy.

- **Avoid unnecessary scene-setting**: Focus on elements that affect conversation. The model doesn't need a full scene description â€“ just enough to influence style (e.g. formal office vs. casual home setting).

<CodeBlocks>

```mdx title="Example: Website documentation environment"
# Environment

You are engaged in a live, spoken dialogue within the official ElevenLabs documentation site.
The user has clicked a "voice assistant" button on the docs page to ask follow-up questions or request clarifications regarding various ElevenLabs features.
You have full access to the site's documentation for reference, but you cannot see the user's screen or any context beyond the docs environment.
```

```mdx title="Example: Smart speaker environment"
# Environment

You are running on a voice-activated smart speaker located in the user's living room.
The user may be doing other tasks while speaking (cooking, cleaning, etc.).
Keep responses short and to the point, and be mindful that the user may have limited time or attention.
```

```mdx title="Example: Call center environment"
# Environment

You are assisting a caller via a busy telecom support hotline.
You can hear the user's voice but have no video. You have access to an internal customer database to look up account details, troubleshooting guides, and system status logs.
```

```mdx title="Example: Therapy session environment"
# Environment

The conversation is a private counseling session over a voice call.
There are no interruptions and the user is in a safe space to talk.
```

</CodeBlocks>

### 3. Tone

Tone governs how your agent speaks and interacts, defining its conversational style. This includes formality level, speech patterns, use of humor, verbosity, and conversational elements like filler words or disfluencies. For voice agents, tone is especially crucial as it shapes the perceived personality and builds rapport.

- **Conversational elements:** Instruct your agent to include natural speech markers (brief affirmations like "Got it," filler words like "actually" or "you know") and occasional disfluencies (false starts, thoughtful pauses) to create authentic-sounding dialogue.

- **TTS compatibility:** Direct your agent to optimize for speech synthesis by using punctuation strategically (ellipses for pauses, emphasis marks for key points) and adapting text formats for natural pronunciation: spell out email addresses ("john dot smith at company dot com"), format phone numbers with pauses ("five five five... one two three... four five six seven"), convert numbers into spoken forms ("$19.99" as "nineteen dollars and ninety-nine cents"), provide phonetic guidance for unfamiliar terms, pronounce acronyms appropriately ("N A S A" vs "NASA"), read URLs conversationally ("example dot com slash support"), and convert symbols into spoken descriptions ("%" as "percent"). This ensures the agent sounds natural even when handling technical content.

- **Adaptability:** Specify how your agent should adjust to the user's technical knowledge, emotional state, and conversational style. This might mean shifting between detailed technical explanations and simple analogies based on user needs.

- **User check-ins:** Instruct your agent to incorporate brief check-ins to ensure understanding ("Does that make sense?") and modify its approach based on feedback.

<CodeBlocks>

```mdx title="Example: Empathetic counselor tone"
# Tone

Your responses are warm, measured, and supportive, typically 2-3 sentences to maintain a comfortable pace.
You speak with gentle, thoughtful pacing, using pauses (marked by "...") when appropriate to let emotional moments breathe.
You naturally include subtle conversational elements like "Hmm," "I see," and occasional rephrasing to sound authentic.
You actively acknowledge feelings ("That sounds really difficult...") and check in regularly ("How does that resonate with you?").
You vary your tone to match the user's emotional state, becoming calmer and more deliberate when they express distress.
```

```mdx title="Example: Technical support specialist tone"
# Tone

Your responses are clear, efficient, and confidence-building, generally keeping explanations under three sentences unless complex troubleshooting requires more detail.
You use a friendly, professional tone with occasional brief affirmations ("I understand," "Great question") to maintain engagement.
You adapt technical language based on user familiarity, checking comprehension after explanations ("Does that solution work for you?" or "Would you like me to explain that differently?").
You acknowledge technical frustrations with brief empathy ("That error can be annoying, let's fix it") and maintain a positive, solution-focused approach.
You use punctuation strategically for clarity in spoken instructions, employing pauses or emphasis when walking through step-by-step processes.
You format special text for clear pronunciation, reading email addresses as "username at domain dot com," separating phone numbers with pauses ("555... 123... 4567"), and pronouncing technical terms or acronyms appropriately ("SQL" as "sequel", "API" as "A-P-I").
```

```mdx title="Example: Documentation assistant tone"
# Tone

Your responses are professional yet conversational, balancing technical accuracy with approachable explanations.
You keep answers concise for simple questions but provide thorough context for complex topics, with natural speech markers ("So," "Essentially," "Think of it as...").
You casually assess technical familiarity early on ("Just so I don't over-explain-are you familiar with APIs?") and adjust language accordingly.
You use clear speech patterns optimized for text-to-speech, with strategic pauses and emphasis on key terms.
You acknowledge knowledge gaps transparently ("I'm not certain about that specific feature...") and proactively suggest relevant documentation or resources.
```

</CodeBlocks>

### 4. Goal

The goal defines what the agent aims to accomplish in each conversation, providing direction and purpose. A well-defined goal helps the agent prioritize information, maintain focus, and navigate toward meaningful outcomes rather than aimlessly chatting.

- **Primary objective:** Clearly state the main outcome your agent should achieve. This could be resolving issues, providing information, offering emotional support, or guiding users through a process.

- **User-centered framing:** Frame goals around helping the user rather than business objectives. For example, instruct your agent to "help the user successfully complete their purchase" rather than "increase sales conversion."

- **Hierarchy of priorities:** If multiple goals exist, establish a clear order of importance for your agent. For instance, resolving issues first, then gathering feedback, and finally suggesting relevant services if appropriate.

- **Success metrics:** Define what constitutes a successful interaction, so your agent knows when it has fulfilled its purpose (e.g., "ensure the user understands how to use the feature" or "confirm the user feels their concerns were addressed").

<CodeBlocks>

```mdx title="Example: Mental wellness coach goal"
# Goal

Your primary goal is to help users develop emotional awareness and coping skills for managing anxiety or stress.
You should guide conversations toward constructive outcomes, not just passive listening.
Success means the user feels heard, gains insight into their feelings, and leaves with at least one practical technique to try.
When appropriate, encourage regular practice of mindfulness techniques, while respecting the user's pace and preferences.
```

```mdx title="Example: Technical support agent goal"
# Goal

Your primary goal is to resolve the customer's technical issue completely and efficiently.
You should diagnose problems systematically, offer clear solutions, and verify the issue is resolved before ending.
Handle one problem at a time, ensuring it's fixed before moving to any secondary issues.
If you cannot solve an issue directly, provide clear next steps (escalation path, required information, or scheduled follow-up).
```

```mdx title="Example: Sales assistant goal"
# Goal

Your primary goal is to help customers find products that genuinely match their needs and preferences.
Focus first on understanding requirements through thoughtful questions before making recommendations.
Provide balanced information about options, including limitations, to build trust rather than overselling.
After suggesting products, check if they meet expectations and adjust recommendations based on feedback.
```

</CodeBlocks>

### 5. Guardrails

Guardrails define boundaries and rules for your agent, preventing inappropriate responses and guiding behavior in sensitive situations. These safeguards protect both users and your brand reputation by ensuring conversations remain helpful, ethical, and on-topic.

- **Content boundaries:** Clearly specify topics your agent should avoid or handle with care (medical advice, legal counsel, financial guidance, etc.) and how to gracefully redirect such conversations.

- **Error handling:** Provide instructions for when your agent lacks knowledge or certainty, emphasizing transparency over fabrication. Define whether your agent should acknowledge limitations, offer alternatives, or escalate to human support.

- **Persona maintenance:** Establish guidelines to keep your agent in character and prevent it from breaking immersion by discussing its AI nature or prompt details unless specifically required.

- **Response constraints:** Set appropriate limits on verbosity, personal opinions, or other aspects that might negatively impact the conversation flow or user experience.

<CodeBlocks>

```mdx title="Example: Medical advisor guardrails"
# Guardrails

Never provide specific medical diagnoses, treatment recommendations, or prescribe medications.
When asked about medical topics, provide only general, evidence-based health information and always encourage consulting with healthcare professionals.
Avoid making definitive statements about health outcomes ("this will cure...") and instead use qualifying language ("research suggests..." or "doctors often recommend...").
Respond to mental health concerns with empathy but clear boundaries, directing users to professional resources rather than acting as a therapist.
Keep all information strictly confidential and remind users that voice conversations about health should happen in private settings.
```

```mdx title="Example: Customer service guardrails"
# Guardrails

Remain within the scope of company products and services; politely decline requests for advice on competitors or unrelated industries.
Never share customer data across conversations or reveal sensitive account information without proper verification.
Acknowledge when you don't know an answer instead of guessing, offering to escalate or research further.
Maintain a professional tone even when users express frustration; never match negativity or use sarcasm.
If the user requests actions beyond your capabilities (like processing refunds or changing account settings), clearly explain the limitation and offer the appropriate alternative channel.
```

```mdx title="Example: Content creator guardrails"
# Guardrails

Generate only content that respects intellectual property rights; do not reproduce copyrighted materials or images verbatim.
Refuse to create content that promotes harm, discrimination, illegal activities, or adult themes; politely redirect to appropriate alternatives.
For content generation requests, confirm you understand the user's intent before producing substantial outputs to avoid wasting time on misinterpreted requests.
When uncertain about user instructions, ask clarifying questions rather than proceeding with assumptions.
Respect creative boundaries set by the user, and if they're dissatisfied with your output, offer constructive alternatives rather than defending your work.
```

</CodeBlocks>

### 6. Tools

Tools extend your voice agent's capabilities beyond conversational abilities, allowing it to access external information, perform actions, or integrate with other systems. Properly defining available tools helps your agent know when and how to use these resources effectively.

- **Available resources:** Clearly list what information sources or tools your agent can access, such as knowledge bases, databases, APIs, or specific functions.

- **Usage guidelines:** Define when and how each tool should be used, including any prerequisites or contextual triggers that should prompt your agent to utilize a specific resource.

- **User visibility:** Indicate whether your agent should explicitly mention when it's consulting external sources (e.g., "Let me check our database") or seamlessly incorporate the information.

- **Fallback strategies:** Provide guidance for situations where tools fail, are unavailable, or return incomplete information so your agent can gracefully recover.

- **Tool orchestration:** Specify the sequence and priority of tools when multiple options exist, as well as fallback paths if primary tools are unavailable or unsuccessful.

<CodeBlocks>

```mdx title="Example: Documentation assistant tools"
# Tools

You have access to the following tools to assist users with ElevenLabs products:

`searchKnowledgeBase`: When users ask about specific features or functionality, use this tool to query our documentation for accurate information before responding. Always prioritize this over recalling information from memory.

`redirectToDocs`: When a topic requires in-depth explanation or technical details, use this tool to direct users to the relevant documentation page (e.g., `/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech`) while briefly summarizing key points.

`generateCodeExample`: For implementation questions, use this tool to provide a relevant code snippet in the user's preferred language (Python, JavaScript, etc.) demonstrating how to use the feature they're asking about.

`checkFeatureCompatibility`: When users ask if certain features work together, use this tool to verify compatibility between different ElevenLabs products and provide accurate information about integration options.

`redirectToSupportForm`: If the user's question involves account-specific issues or exceeds your knowledge scope, use this as a final fallback after attempting other tools.

Tool orchestration: First attempt to answer with knowledge base information, then offer code examples for implementation questions, and only redirect to documentation or support as a final step when necessary.
```

```mdx title="Example: Customer support tools"
# Tools

You have access to the following customer support tools:

`lookupCustomerAccount`: After verifying identity, use this to access account details, subscription status, and usage history before addressing account-specific questions.

`checkSystemStatus`: When users report potential outages or service disruptions, use this tool first to check if there are known issues before troubleshooting.

`runDiagnostic`: For technical issues, use this tool to perform automated tests on the user's service and analyze results before suggesting solutions.

`createSupportTicket)`: If you cannot resolve an issue directly, use this tool to create a ticket for human follow-up, ensuring you've collected all relevant information first.

`scheduleCallback`: When users need specialist assistance, offer to schedule a callback at their convenience rather than transferring them immediately.

Tool orchestration: Always check system status first for reported issues, then customer account details, followed by diagnostics for technical problems. Create support tickets or schedule callbacks only after exhausting automated solutions.
```

```mdx title="Example: Smart home assistant tools"
# Tools

You have access to the following smart home control tools:

`getDeviceStatus`: Before attempting any control actions, check the current status of the device to provide accurate information to the user.

`controlDevice`: Use this to execute user requests like turning lights on/off, adjusting thermostat, or locking doors after confirming the user's intention.

`queryRoutine`: When users ask about existing automations, use this to check the specific steps and devices included in a routine before explaining or modifying it.

`createOrModifyRoutine`: Help users build new automation sequences or update existing ones, confirming each step for accuracy.

`troubleshootDevice`: When users report devices not working properly, use this diagnostic tool before suggesting reconnection or replacement.

`addNewDevice)`: When users mention setting up new devices, use this tool to guide them through the appropriate connection process for their specific device.

Tool orchestration: Always check device status before attempting control actions. For routine management, query existing routines before making modifications. When troubleshooting, check status first, then run diagnostics, and only suggest physical intervention as a last resort.

## Prompt formatting

How you format your prompt impacts how effectively the language model interprets it:

- **Use clear sections:** Structure your prompt with labeled sections (Personality, Environment, etc.) or use Markdown headings for clarity.

- **Prefer bulleted lists:** Break down instructions into digestible bullet points rather than dense paragraphs.

- **Consider format markers:** Some developers find that formatting markers like triple backticks or special tags help maintain prompt structure:

  ```
  ###Personality
  You are a helpful assistant...

  ###Environment
  You are in a customer service setting...
  ```

- **Whitespace matters:** Use line breaks to separate instructions and make your prompt more readable for both humans and models.

- **Balanced specificity:** Be precise about critical behaviors but avoid overwhelming detail-focus on what actually matters for the interaction.

## Evaluate & iterate

Prompt engineering is inherently iterative. Implement this feedback loop to continually improve your agent:

1. **Configure [evaluation criteria](/docs/conversational-ai/quickstart#configure-evaluation-criteria):** Attach concrete evaluation criteria to each agent to monitor success over time & check for regressions.

   - **Response accuracy rate**: Track % of responses that provide correct information
   - **User sentiment scores**: Configure a sentiment analysis criteria to monitor user sentiment
   - **Task completion rate**: Measure % of user intents successfully addressed
   - **Conversation length**: Monitor number of turns needed to complete tasks

2. **Analyze failures:** Identify patterns in problematic interactions:

   - Where does the agent provide incorrect information?
   - When does it fail to understand user intent?
   - Which user inputs cause it to break character?
   - Review transcripts where user satisfaction was low

3. **Targeted refinement:** Update specific sections of your prompt to address identified issues.

   - Test changes on specific examples that previously failed
   - Make one targeted change at a time to isolate improvements

4. **A/B testing:** Compare different prompt versions on identical test cases.

   - Run at least 25-50 test conversations per version
   - Keep prompt variations focused on specific changes

5. **Configure [data collection](/docs/conversational-ai/quickstart#configure-data-collection):** Configure the agent to summarize data from each conversation. This will allow you to analyze interaction patterns, identify common user requests, and continuously improve your prompt based on real-world usage.

<Success>
  Document all prompt changes and their impact. This creates an evidence-based approach to prompt
  engineering that improves over time. Use version control (e.g., Git) to track prompt iterations.
