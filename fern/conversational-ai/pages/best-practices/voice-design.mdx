## Voice settings

Voice settings dramatically affect how your agent is perceived:

- **Stability:** Lower values (0.30-0.50) create more emotional, dynamic delivery but may occasionally sound unstable. Higher values (0.60-0.85) produce more consistent but potentially monotonous output.

- **Similarity:** Higher values will boost the overall clarity and consistency of the voice. Very high values may lead to sound distortions. Adjusting this value to find the right balance is recommended.

- **Speed:** Most natural conversations occur at 0.9-1.1x speed. Depending on the voice, adjust slower for complex topics or faster for routine information.

<Tip>
  Test your agent with different voice settings using the same prompt to find the optimal
  combination. Small adjustments can dramatically change the perceived personality of your agent.
