## Installation

Install the `elevenlabs` Python package in your project:

```shell
pip install elevenlabs
# or
poetry add elevenlabs
```

If you want to use the default implementation of audio input/output you will also need the `pyaudio` extra:

```shell
pip install "elevenlabs[pyaudio]"
# or
poetry add "elevenlabs[pyaudio]"
```

<Info>
The `pyaudio` package installation might require additional system dependencies.

See [PyAudio package README](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/) for more information.

## Usage

In this example we will create a simple script that runs a conversation with the ElevenLabs Conversational AI agent.
You can find the full code in the [ElevenLabs examples repository](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-examples/tree/main/examples/conversational-ai/python).

First import the necessary dependencies:

```python
import os
import signal

from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs
from elevenlabs.conversational_ai.conversation import Conversation
from elevenlabs.conversational_ai.default_audio_interface import DefaultAudioInterface
```

Next load the agent ID and API key from environment variables:

```python
agent_id = os.getenv("AGENT_ID")
api_key = os.getenv("ELEVENLABS_API_KEY")
```

The API key is only required for non-public agents that have authentication enabled.
You don't have to set it for public agents and the code will work fine without it.

Then create the `ElevenLabs` client instance:

```python
elevenlabs = ElevenLabs(api_key=api_key)
```

Now we initialize the `Conversation` instance:

```python
conversation = Conversation(
    # API client and agent ID.
    elevenlabs,
    agent_id,

    # Assume auth is required when API_KEY is set.
    requires_auth=bool(api_key),

    # Use the default audio interface.
    audio_interface=DefaultAudioInterface(),

    # Simple callbacks that print the conversation to the console.
    callback_agent_response=lambda response: print(f"Agent: {response}"),
    callback_agent_response_correction=lambda original, corrected: print(f"Agent: {original} -> {corrected}"),
    callback_user_transcript=lambda transcript: print(f"User: {transcript}"),

    # Uncomment if you want to see latency measurements.
    # callback_latency_measurement=lambda latency: print(f"Latency: {latency}ms"),
)
```

We are using the `DefaultAudioInterface` which uses the default system audio input/output devices for the conversation.
You can also implement your own audio interface by subclassing `elevenlabs.conversational_ai.conversation.AudioInterface`.

Now we can start the conversation. Optionally, we recommended passing in your own end user IDs to map conversations to your users.

```python
conversation.start_session(
    user_id=user_id # optional field
)
```

To get a clean shutdown when the user presses `Ctrl+C` we can add a signal handler which will call `end_session()`:

```python
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, lambda sig, frame: conversation.end_session())
```

And lastly we wait for the conversation to end and print out the conversation ID (which can be used for reviewing the conversation history and debugging):

```python
conversation_id = conversation.wait_for_session_end()
print(f"Conversation ID: {conversation_id}")
```

All that is left is to run the script and start talking to the agent:

```shell
# For public agents:
AGENT_ID=youragentid python demo.py

# For private agents:
AGENT_ID=youragentid ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=yourapikey python demo.py
```
