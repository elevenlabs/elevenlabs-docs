subtitle: Integrate ElevenLabs conversational AI agents with Genesys using native Audio Connector integration.
---

## Overview

This guide explains how to integrate ElevenLabs conversational AI agents with Genesys Cloud using the Audio Connector integration. This integration enables seamless voice AI capabilities within your existing Genesys contact center infrastructure over websocket, without requiring SIP trunking.

## How Genesys integration works

The Genesys integration uses a native WebSocket connection through the Audio Connector integration:

1. **WebSocket connection**: Direct connection to ElevenLabs using the Audio Connector integration in Genesys Cloud
2. **Real-time audio**: Bidirectional audio streaming between Genesys and ElevenLabs agents
3. **Flow integration**: Seamless integration within your Genesys Architect flows using bot actions
4. **Dynamic variables**: Support for passing context and data between Genesys and ElevenLabs

## Requirements

Before setting up the Genesys integration, ensure you have:

1. Genesys Cloud CX license with bot flow capabilities
2. Administrator access to Genesys Cloud organization
3. A configured ElevenLabs account and conversational AI agent
4. ElevenLabs API key

## Setting up the Audio Connector integration

<Steps>

<Step title="Access Genesys Cloud Admin">
  Sign in to your Genesys Cloud organization with administrator privileges.
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
  Go to Admin → Integrations in the Genesys Cloud interface.
</Step>

<Step title="Create Audio Connector integration">

1. Click "Add Integration" and search for "Audio Connector", and click "Install"

2. Select the Audio Connector integration type

3. Provide a descriptive name for your integration

</Step>

<Step title="Configure authentication">

1. Navigate to the Configuration section of your Audio Connector integration

2. In Properties, in the Base Connection URI field, enter: `wss://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation/genesys`

3. In Credentials, enter your ElevenLabs API key in the authentication configuration

4. Save the integration configuration

</Step>

<Step title="Activate the integration">
  Set the integration status to "Active" to enable the connection.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Configuring your Genesys flow

<Steps>

<Step title="Open Architect">Navigate to Admin → Architect in Genesys Cloud.</Step>

<Step title="Create or edit a flow">
  Open an existing inbound, outbound, or in-queue call flow, or create a new one where you want to
  use the ElevenLabs agent.
</Step>

<Step title="Add bot action">

1. In your flow, add a "Call Audio Connector" action from the Bot category

2. Select your Audio Connector integration from the integration dropdown

3. In the Connector ID field, specify your ElevenLabs agent ID

</Step>

<Step title="Configure session variables (optional)">
  If you need to pass context to your ElevenLabs agent, configure input session variables in the bot
  action. These will be available as dynamic variables in your ElevenLabs agent.
</Step>

<Step title="Publish your flow">Save and publish your flow to make the integration active.</Step>

</Steps>

## Agent configuration requirements

Your ElevenLabs conversational AI agent must be configured with specific audio settings for Genesys compatibility:

### Audio format requirements

- **TTS output format**: Set to μ-law 8000 Hz in Agent Settings → Voice
- **User input audio format**: Set to μ-law 8000 Hz in Agent Settings → Advanced

### Supported client events

The Genesys integration supports only the following client events:

- **Audio events**: For processing voice input from callers
- **Interruption events**: For handling caller interruptions during agent speech

<Note>
  Other client event types are not supported in the Genesys integration and will be silently ignored
  if configured.
</Note>

## Session variables

You can pass dynamic context from your Genesys flow to your ElevenLabs agent using input session variables:

### Setting up session variables

1. **In Genesys flow**: Define input session variables in your "Call Audio Connector" action
2. **In ElevenLabs agent**: These variables are automatically available as dynamic variables
3. **Usage**: Reference these variables in your agent's conversation flow or system prompts

Learn more about [dynamic variables](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/personalization/dynamic-variables).

### Example usage

Genesys Flow input session variable: customer_name = "John Smith"

ElevenLabs agent prompt: Hi {{customer_name}}, how can I help you today?

<Info>
  Output session variables from ElevenLabs agents back to Genesys flows are coming soon. This
  feature will allow you to capture conversation outcomes and route calls accordingly.
</Info>

## Limitations and unsupported features

The following tools and features are not supported in the Genesys integration:

### Unsupported tools

- **Client tool**: Not compatible with Genesys WebSocket integration
- **Transfer to number**: Use Genesys native transfer capabilities instead

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="WebSocket connection fails">
    Verify that your API key is correctly configured in the Audio Connector integration and the ElevenLabs agent ID is correctly configured in the Connector ID field in your Architect flow.
    If there are any dynamic variables defined on your agent, they must be passed in as input session variables.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Session variables not working">
    Verify that input session variables are properly defined in your Genesys flow's "Call Audio Connector" action and that they're referenced correctly in your ElevenLabs agent using the {{variable_name}} syntax.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
