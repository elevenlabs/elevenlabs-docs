subtitle: Learn how to test and evaluate your Conversational AI agent with simulated conversations
---

## Overview

The ElevenLabs Conversational AI API allows you to simulate and evaluate text-based conversations with your AI agent. This guide will teach you how to implement an end-to-end simulation testing workflow using the simulate conversation endpoints ([batch](/docs/api-reference/agents/simulate-conversation) and [streaming](/docs/api-reference/agents/simulate-conversation-stream)), enabling you to granularly test and improve your agent's performance to ensure it meets your interaction goals.

## Prerequisites

- An agent configured in ElevenLabs Conversational AI ([create one here](/docs/conversational-ai/quickstart))
- Your ElevenLabs API key, which you can [create in the dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys)

## Implementing a Simulation Testing Workflow

<Steps>

<Step title="Identify initial evaluation parameters">
Search through your agent's conversation history and find instances where your agent has underperformed. Use those conversations to create various prompts for a simulated user who will interact with your agent. Additionally, define any extra evaluation criteria not already specified in your agent configuration to test outcomes you may want for a specific simulated user.

</Step>

<Step title="Simulate the conversation via the SDK">
Create a request to the simulation endpoint using the ElevenLabs SDK.

<CodeGroup>

```python title="Python"
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from elevenlabs import (
    ElevenLabs,
    ConversationSimulationSpecification,
    AgentConfig,
    PromptAgent,
    PromptEvaluationCriteria
)

load_dotenv()
api_key = os.getenv("ELEVENLABS_API_KEY")
elevenlabs = ElevenLabs(api_key=api_key)

response = elevenlabs.conversational_ai.agents.simulate_conversation(
    agent_id="YOUR_AGENT_ID",
    simulation_specification=ConversationSimulationSpecification(
        simulated_user_config=AgentConfig(
            prompt=PromptAgent(
                prompt="Your goal is to be a really difficult user.",
                llm="gpt-4o",
                temperature=0.5
            )
        )
    ),
    extra_evaluation_criteria=[
        PromptEvaluationCriteria(
            id="politeness_check",
            name="Politeness Check",
            conversation_goal_prompt="The agent was polite.",
            use_knowledge_base=False
        )
    ]
)

print(response)

```

```typescript title="TypeScript"
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import { ElevenLabsClient } from 'elevenlabs';

dotenv.config();
const apiKey = process.env.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY;
const elevenlabs = new ElevenLabsClient({
  apiKey: apiKey,
});
const response = await elevenlabs.conversationalAi.agents.simulateConversation('YOUR_AGENT_ID', {
  simulation_specification: {
    simulated_user_config: {
      prompt: {
        prompt: 'Your goal is to be a really difficult user.',
        llm: 'gpt-4o',
        temperature: 0.5,
      },
    },
  },
  extra_evaluation_criteria: [
    {
      id: 'politeness_check',
      name: 'Politeness Check',
      conversation_goal_prompt: 'The agent was polite.',
      use_knowledge_base: false,
    },
  ],
});
console.log(JSON.stringify(response, null, 4));
```

  This is a basic example. For a comprehensive list of input parameters, please refer to the API
  reference for [Simulate conversation](/docs/api-reference/agents/simulate-conversation) and
  [Stream simulate conversation](/docs/api-reference/agents/simulate-conversation-stream) endpoints.

<Step title="Analyze the response">
The SDK provides a comprehensive JSON object that includes the entire conversation transcript and detailed analysis.

**Simulated Conversation**: Captures each interaction turn between the simulated user and the agent, detailing messages and tool usage.

</Step>

<Step title="Improve your evaluation criteria">
  Review the simulated conversations thoroughly to assess the effectiveness of your evaluation
  criteria. Identify any gaps or areas where the criteria may fall short in evaluating the agent's
  performance. Refine and adjust the evaluation criteria accordingly to ensure they align with your
  desired outcomes and accurately measure the agent's capabilities.
</Step>

<Step title="Improve your agent">
  Once you are confident in the accuracy of your evaluation criteria, use the learnings from
  simulated conversations to enhance your agent's capabilities. Consider refining the system prompt
  to better guide the agent's responses, ensuring they align with your objectives and user
  expectations. Additionally, explore other features or configurations that could be optimized, such
  as adjusting the agent's tone, improving its ability to handle specific queries, or integrating
  additional data sources to enrich its responses. By systematically applying these learnings, you
  can create a more robust and effective conversational agent that delivers a superior user
  experience.
</Step>

<Step title="Continuous iteration">
  After completing an initial testing and improvement cycle, establishing a comprehensive testing
  suite can be a great way to cover a broad range of possible scenarios. This suite can explore
  multiple simulated conversations using varied simulated user prompts and starting conditions. By
  continuously iterating and refining your approach, you can ensure your agent remains effective and
  responsive to evolving user needs.
</Step>

## Pro Tips

#### Detailed Prompts and Criteria

Crafting detailed and verbose simulated user prompts and evaluation criteria can enhance the effectiveness of the simulation tests. The more context and specificity you provide, the better the agent can understand and respond to complex interactions.

#### Mock Tool Configurations

Utilize mock tool configurations to test the decision-making process of your agent. This allows you to observe how the agent decides to make tool calls and react to different tool call results. For more details, check out the tool_mock_config input parameter from the [API reference](/docs/api-reference/agents/simulate-conversation#request.body.simulation_specification.tool_mock_config).

#### Partial Conversation History

Use partial conversation histories to evaluate how agents handle interactions from a specific point. This is particularly useful for assessing the agent's ability to manage conversations where the user has already set up a question in a specific way, or if there have been certain tool calls that have succeeded or failed. For more details, check out the partial_conversation_history input parameter from the [API reference](/docs/api-reference/agents/simulate-conversation#request.body.simulation_specification.partial_conversation_history).
