This tutorial will guide you through adding your ElevenLabs Conversational AI agent to your Ghost website.

## Prerequisites

- An ElevenLabs Conversational AI agent created following [this guide](/docs/conversational-ai/docs/agent-setup)
- A Ghost website (paid plan or self-hosted)
- Access to Ghost admin panel

## Guide

There are two ways to add the widget to your Ghost site:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Get your embed code">
        Visit the [ElevenLabs dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai) and copy your agent's html widget.

        ```html
        <elevenlabs-convai agent-id="YOUR_AGENT_ID"></elevenlabs-convai>
        <script src="https://elevenlabs.io/convai-widget/index.js" async type="text/javascript"></script>
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Choose your implementation">
        **Option A: Add globally (all pages)**
        1. Go to Ghost Admin > Settings > Code Injection
        2. Paste the code into Site Footer
        3. Save changes

        **Option B: Add to specific pages**
        1. Edit your desired page/post
        2. Click the + sign to add an HTML block
        3. Paste your agent's html widget from step 1 into the HTML block. Make sure to fill in the agent-id attribute correctly.
        4. Save and publish
    </Step>

    <Step title="Test the integration">
        1. Visit your Ghost website
        2. Verify the widget appears and functions correctly
        3. Test on different devices and browsers
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If the widget isn't appearing, verify:

- The code is correctly placed in either Code Injection or HTML block
- Your Ghost plan supports custom code
- No JavaScript conflicts with other scripts

## Next steps

Now that you have added your Conversational AI agent to Ghost, you can:

1. Customize the widget in the ElevenLabs dashboard to match your brand
2. Add additional languages
3. Add advanced functionality like tools & knowledge base
