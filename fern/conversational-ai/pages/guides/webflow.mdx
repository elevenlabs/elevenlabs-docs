This tutorial will guide you through adding your ElevenLabs Conversational AI agent to your Webflow website.

## Prerequisites

- An ElevenLabs Conversational AI agent created following [this guide](/docs/conversational-ai/docs/agent-setup)
- A Webflow account with Core, Growth, Agency, or Freelancer Workspace (or Site Plan)
- Basic familiarity with Webflow's Designer

## Guide

<Steps>
    <Step title="Get your embed code">
        Visit the [ElevenLabs dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai) and find your agent's embed widget.
        ```html
        <elevenlabs-convai agent-id="YOUR_AGENT_ID"></elevenlabs-convai>
        <script src="https://elevenlabs.io/convai-widget/index.js" async type="text/javascript"></script>
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add the widget to your page">
        1. Open your Webflow project in Designer
        2. Drag an Embed Element to your desired location
        3. Paste the `<elevenlabs-convai agent-id="YOUR_AGENT_ID"></elevenlabs-convai>` snippet into the Embed Element's code editor
        4. Save & Close
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add the script globally">

        1. Go to Project Settings > Custom Code
        2. Paste the snippet `<script src="https://elevenlabs.io/convai-widget/index.js" async type="text/javascript"></script>` into the Footer Code section
        3. Save Changes
        4. Publish your site to see the changes
    </Step>

</Steps>

Note: The widget will only be visible after publishing your site, not in the Designer.

## Troubleshooting

If the widget isn't appearing, verify:

- The `<script>` snippet is in the Footer Code section
- The `<elevenlabs-convai>` snippet is correctly placed in an Embed Element
- You've published your site after making changes

## Next steps

Now that you have added your Conversational AI agent to Webflow, you can:

1. Customize the widget in the ElevenLabs dashboard to match your brand
2. Add additional languages
3. Add advanced functionality like tools & knowledge base
