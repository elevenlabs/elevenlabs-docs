This tutorial will guide you through adding your ElevenLabs Conversational AI agent to your Wix website.

## Prerequisites

- An ElevenLabs Conversational AI agent created following [this guide](/docs/conversational-ai/docs/agent-setup)
- A Wix Premium account (required for custom code)
- Access to Wix Editor with Dev Mode enabled

## Guide

<Steps>
    <Step title="Get your embed code">
        Visit the [ElevenLabs dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai) and copy your agent's embed code.
        ```html
        <elevenlabs-convai agent-id="YOUR_AGENT_ID"></elevenlabs-convai>
        <script src="https://elevenlabs.io/convai-widget/index.js" async type="text/javascript"></script>
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Enable Dev Mode">
        1. Open your Wix site in the Editor
        2. Click on Dev Mode in the top menu
        3. If Dev Mode is not visible, ensure you're using the full Wix Editor, not Wix ADI
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add the embed snippet">
        1. Go to Settings > Custom Code
        2. Click + Add Custom Code
        3. Paste your ElevenLabs embed snippet from step 1 with the agent-id attribute filled in correctly
        4. Select the pages you would like to add the Conversational AI widget to (all pages, or specific pages)
        5. Save and publish
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If the widget isn't appearing, verify:

- You're using a Wix Premium plan
- Your site's domain is properly configured in the ElevenLabs allowlist
- The code is added correctly in the Custom Code section

## Next steps

Now that you have added your Conversational AI agent to Wix, you can:

1. Customize the widget in the ElevenLabs dashboard to match your brand
2. Add additional languages
3. Add advanced functionality like tools & knowledge base
