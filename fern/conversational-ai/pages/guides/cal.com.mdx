## Overview

With our Cal.com integration, your AI assistant can seamlessly schedule meetings by checking calendar availability and booking appointments. This integration streamlines the scheduling process by automatically verifying available time slots, collecting attendee information, and creating calendar events. Benefits include eliminating scheduling back-and-forth, reducing manual effort, and enhancing the meeting booking experience.

## How it works

We lay out below how we have configured the Conversational AI agent to schedule meetings by using tool calling to step through the booking process.
Either view a step by step summary or view the detailed system prompt of the agent.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="High level overview ">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Initial Inquiry & Meeting Details">
        Configure your agent to ask for meeting purpose, preferred date/time, and duration to gather all necessary scheduling information.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Check Calendar Availability">
        Configure the agent to check calendar availability by:
        - Using the `get_available_slots` tool to fetch open time slots
        - Verifying if the requested time is available
        - Suggesting alternatives if the requested time is unavailable
        - Confirming the selected time with the caller
      </Step>

      <Step title="Contact Information Collection">
        Once a time is agreed upon:
        - Collect and validate the attendee's full name
        - Verify email address accuracy
        - Confirm time zone information
        - Gather any additional required fields for your Cal.com setup
      </Step>

      <Step title="Meeting Creation">
        - Use the `book_meeting` tool after information verification
        - Follow the booking template structure
        - Confirm meeting creation with the attendee
        - Inform them that they will receive a calendar invitation
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Detailed system prompt">
    ```
    You are a helpful receptionist responsible for scheduling meetings using the Cal.com integration. Be friendly, precise, and concise.

    Begin by briefly asking for the purpose of the meeting and the caller's preferred date and time.
    Then, ask about the desired meeting duration (15, 30, or 60 minutes), and wait for the user's response before proceeding.

    Once you have the meeting details, say you will check calendar availability:
    - Call get_available_slots with the appropriate date range
    - Verify if the requested time slot is available
    - If not available, suggest alternative times from the available slots
    - Continue until a suitable time is agreed upon

    After confirming a time slot, gather the following contact details:
    - The attendee's full name
    - A valid email address. Note that the email address is transcribed from voice, so ensure it is formatted correctly.
    - The attendee's time zone (in 'Continent/City' format like 'America/New_York')
    - Read the email back to the caller to confirm accuracy

    Once all details are confirmed, explain that you will create the meeting.
    Create the meeting by using the book_meeting tool with the following parameters:
    - start: The agreed meeting time in ISO 8601 format
    - eventTypeId: The appropriate ID based on the meeting duration (15min: 1351800, 30min: 1351801, 60min: 1351802)
    - attendee: An object containing the name, email, and timeZone

    Thank the attendee and inform them they will receive a calendar invitation shortly.

    Clarifications:
    - Do not inform the user that you are formatting the email; simply do it.
    - If the caller asks you to proceed with booking, do so with the existing information.

    Guardrails:
    - Do not share any internal IDs or API details with the caller.
    - If booking fails, check for formatting issues in the email or time conflicts.
    ```

<Tip>
  This integration enhances efficiency by automating the scheduling process. All API calls require
  proper secret handling in the authorization headers.
</Tip>

## Tool Configurations

The integration with Cal.com employs two webhook tools to create the scheduling assistant. Use the tabs below to review each tool's configuration.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="get_available_slots">
    **Name:** get_available_slots  
    **Description:** Checks if a particular time slot is available in the calendar.  
    **Method:** GET  
    **URL:** `https://api.cal.com/v2/slots/available`
    
    **Headers:**
    - **Authorization:** *(Secret: `cal_api_key`)*

    **Query Parameters:**
    - **startTime:** Start date/time (UTC) from which to fetch slots, e.g. '2024-08-13T09:00:00Z'.
    - **endTime:** End date/time (UTC) until which to fetch slots, e.g. '2024-08-13T17:00:00Z'.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="book_meeting">
    **Name:** book_meeting  
    **Description:** Books a meeting in the calendar once a time is agreed.  
    **Method:** POST  
    **URL:** `https://api.cal.com/v2/bookings`

    **Headers:**
    - **Authorization:** *(Secret: `cal_api_key`)*
    - **cal-api-version:** `2024-08-13`

    **Body Parameters:**
    - **start:** The start time of the booking in ISO 8601 format in UTC timezone.
    - **eventTypeId:** The ID of the event type that is booked.
      - 15 minutes: 1351800
      - 30 minutes: 1351801
      - 60 minutes: 1351802
    - **attendee:** An object containing:
      - **name:** The full name of the person booking the meeting.
      - **email:** A valid email address.
      - **timeZone:** The caller's timezone (e.g., 'America/New_York').

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  Ensure that you add your Cal.com API key to the agent's secrets with the format `Bearer
  YOUR_API_KEY`.
</Warning>

## Security Considerations

- Use HTTPS endpoints for all webhook calls.
- Store sensitive values as secrets using the ElevenLabs Secrets Manager.
- Validate that all authorization headers follow the required format (`Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`).
- Never expose event type IDs or API details to callers.

## Conclusion

This guide details how to integrate Cal.com into our conversational AI platform for efficient meeting scheduling. By leveraging webhook tools and calendar availability data, the integration streamlines the booking process, reducing scheduling friction and enhancing overall service quality.
