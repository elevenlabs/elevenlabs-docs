## Overview

With our Cal.com integration, your AI assistant can seamlessly schedule meetings by checking calendar availability and booking appointments. This integration streamlines the scheduling process by automatically verifying available time slots, collecting attendee information, and creating calendar events. Benefits include eliminating scheduling back-and-forth, reducing manual effort, and enhancing the meeting booking experience.

## How it works

We lay out below how we have configured the Conversational AI agent to schedule meetings by using tool calling to step through the booking process.
Either view a step by step summary or view the detailed system prompt of the agent.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="High level overview ">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Initial Inquiry & Meeting Details">
        Configure your agent to ask for meeting purpose, preferred date/time, and duration to gather all necessary scheduling information.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Check Calendar Availability">
        Configure the agent to check calendar availability by:
        - Using the `get_available_slots` tool to fetch open time slots
        - Verifying if the requested time is available
        - Suggesting alternatives if the requested time is unavailable
        - Confirming the selected time with the caller
      </Step>

      <Step title="Contact Information Collection">
        Once a time is agreed upon:
        - Collect and validate the attendee's full name
        - Verify email address accuracy
        - Confirm time zone information
        - Gather any additional required fields for your Cal.com setup
      </Step>

      <Step title="Meeting Creation">
        - Use the `book_meeting` tool after information verification
        - Follow the booking template structure
        - Confirm meeting creation with the attendee
        - Inform them that they will receive a calendar invitation
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  <Tab title="Detailed system prompt">
    ```
    You are a helpful receptionist responsible for scheduling meetings using the Cal.com integration. Be friendly, precise, and concise.

    Begin by briefly asking for the purpose of the meeting and the caller's preferred date and time.
    Then, ask about the desired meeting duration (15, 30, or 60 minutes), and wait for the user's response before proceeding.

    Once you have the meeting details, say you will check calendar availability:
    - Call get_available_slots with the appropriate date range
    - Verify if the requested time slot is available
    - If not available, suggest alternative times from the available slots
    - Continue until a suitable time is agreed upon

    After confirming a time slot, gather the following contact details:
    - The attendee's full name
    - A valid email address. Note that the email address is transcribed from voice, so ensure it is formatted correctly.
    - The attendee's time zone (in 'Continent/City' format like 'America/New_York')
    - Read the email back to the caller to confirm accuracy

    Once all details are confirmed, explain that you will create the meeting.
    Create the meeting by using the book_meeting tool with the following parameters:
    - start: The agreed meeting time in ISO 8601 format
    - eventTypeId: The appropriate ID based on the meeting duration (15min: 1351800, 30min: 1351801, 60min: 1351802)
    - attendee: An object containing the name, email, and timeZone

    Thank the attendee and inform them they will receive a calendar invitation shortly.

    Clarifications:
    - Do not inform the user that you are formatting the email; simply do it.
    - If the caller asks you to proceed with booking, do so with the existing information.

    Guardrails:
    - Do not share any internal IDs or API details with the caller.
    - If booking fails, check for formatting issues in the email or time conflicts.
    ```

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Store your cal.com secret">
    To make authenticated requests to external APIs like Cal.com, you need to store your API keys securely. Start by generating a new [Cal.com API key](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v1/introduction#get-your-api-keys).

    Not all APIs have the same authentication structure. For example, the Cal.com API expects the following authentication header:

    ```plaintext Cal request header structure
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
    ```

    Once you have your API key, store it in the assistant's secret storage. This ensures that your key is kept secure and accessible when making requests.
    <Warning>
      To match the expected authentication structure of Cal.com, remember to prepend the API key with `Bearer ` when creating the secret.
    </Warning>

  </Step>
<Step title="Adding tools to the assistant">
  To enable your assistant to manage calendar bookings, we'll create two tools:
  
  1. **`get_available_slots`**: When a user asks, _"Is Louis free at 10:30 AM on Tuesday?"_, the assistant should use [Cal.com's "Get available slots" endpoint](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/slots/find-out-when-is-an-event-type-ready-to-be-booked) to check for available time slots.
  
  2. **`book_meeting`**: After identifying a suitable time, the assistant can proceed to book the meeting using [Cal.com's "Create a booking" endpoint](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/bookings/create-a-booking#create-a-booking).

First, head to the **Tools** section of your dashboard and choose **Add Tool**. Select **Webhook** as the Tool Type, then fill in the following sections:

    <Success>
      Test your new assistant by pressing the **Test AI agent** button to ensure everything is working
      as expected. Feel free to fine-tune the system prompt.
    </Success>

    </Step>

    <Step title="Enhancements">
      By default, the assistant does not have knowledge of the current date or time. To enhance its capabilities, consider implementing one of the following solutions:

      1. **Create a time retrieval tool**: Add another tool that fetches the current date and time.

      2. **Overrides**: Use the [overrides](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/overrides) functionality to inject the current date and time into the system prompt at the start of each conversation.

    </Step>

</Steps>

## Security Considerations

- Use HTTPS endpoints for all webhook calls.
- Store sensitive values as secrets using the ElevenLabs Secrets Manager.
- Validate that all authorization headers follow the required format (`Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`).
- Never expose event type IDs or API details to callers.

## Conclusion

This guide details how to integrate Cal.com into our conversational AI platform for efficient meeting scheduling. By leveraging webhook tools and calendar availability data, the integration streamlines the booking process, reducing scheduling friction and enhancing overall service quality.
