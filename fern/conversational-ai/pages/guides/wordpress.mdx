This tutorial will guide you through adding your ElevenLabs Conversational AI agent to your WordPress website.

## Prerequisites

- An ElevenLabs Conversational AI agent created following [this guide](/docs/conversational-ai/docs/agent-setup)
- A WordPress website with either:
  - WordPress.com Business/Commerce plan, or
  - Self-hosted WordPress installation

## Guide

<Steps>
    <Step title="Get your embed code">
        Visit the [ElevenLabs dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai) and find your agent's embed widget.
        ```html
        <elevenlabs-convai agent-id="YOUR_AGENT_ID"></elevenlabs-convai>
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/@elevenlabs/convai-widget-embed" async type="text/javascript"></script>
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add the widget to a page">
        1. In WordPress, edit your desired page
        2. Add a Custom HTML block
        3. Paste the `<elevenlabs-convai agent-id="YOUR_AGENT_ID"></elevenlabs-convai>` snippet into the block
        4. Update/publish the page
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add the script globally">
        **Option A: Using a plugin**
        1. Install Header Footer Code Manager
        2. Add the snippet `<script src="https://unpkg.com/@elevenlabs/convai-widget-embed" async type="text/javascript"></script>` to the Footer section
        3. Set it to run on All Pages

        **Option B: Direct theme editing**
        1. Go to Appearance > Theme Editor
        2. Open footer.php
        3. Paste the script snippet before `</body>`
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If the widget isn't appearing, verify:

- The `<script>` snippet is added globally
- The `<elevenlabs-convai>` snippet is correctly placed in your page
- You've published your site after making changes
