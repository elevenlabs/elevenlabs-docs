title: SIP Trunking
subtitle: Connect your existing phone system with ElevenLabs conversational AI agents using SIP trunking
---

## Overview

SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) trunking allows you to connect your existing telephony infrastructure directly to ElevenLabs conversational AI agents.
This integration enables enterprise customers to use their existing phone systems while leveraging ElevenLabs' advanced voice AI capabilities.

With SIP trunking, you can:

- Connect your Private Branch Exchange (PBX) or SIP-enabled phone system to ElevenLabs' voice AI platform
- Route calls to AI agents without changing your existing phone infrastructure
- Handle both inbound and outbound call scenarios

## How SIP Trunking works

SIP trunking establishes a direct connection between your telephony infrastructure and the ElevenLabs platform:

1. **Inbound calls**: Calls from your SIP trunk are routed to the ElevenLabs platform our origination URI.
2. **Outbound calls**: ElevenLabs routes calls back to your system using your configured termination URI.
3. **Authentication**: Connection security is maintained through either digest authentication (username/password) or Access Control List (ACL) authentication.

## Requirements

Before setting up SIP trunking, ensure you have:

1. A SIP-compatible PBX or telephony system
2. Phone numbers that you want to connect to ElevenLabs
3. Administrator access to your SIP trunk configuration
4. Appropriate firewall settings to allow SIP traffic

## Setting Up SIP Trunking

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Phone Numbers">
    Go to the [Phone Numbers section](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/phone-numbers) in the ElevenLabs Conversational AI dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import SIP Trunk">
    Click on "Import a phone number from SIP trunk" button to open the configuration dialog.

    </Frame>

    <Frame background="subtle">

    </Frame>

    When you import a SIP trunk, the system automatically configures the ElevenLabs origination URI for inbound calls:
    `sip:sip.rtc.eleven2.dev:5060;transport=tcp`

    This pre-populated URI cannot be modified and serves as the destination endpoint where your system should route all inbound calls (calls from your system to ElevenLabs).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter configuration details">
    Complete the form with the following information:

    - **Label**: A descriptive name for the phone number
    - **Phone Number**: The E.164 formatted phone number to connect (e.g., +15551234567)
    - **Termination URI**: Your SIP trunk's termination URI (where ElevenLabs will send outbound calls)

    </Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure authentication (optional)">

    If your SIP provider requires digest authentication:

    - Enter the username for SIP digest authentication
    - Enter the password for SIP digest authentication

    <Frame background="subtle">
      <img src="/assets/images/conversational-ai/sip-trunk-outbound.png" alt="SIP trunk outbound configuration" />
    </Frame>

    If left empty, ACL authentication will be used (you'll need to allowlist ElevenLabs IPs in your provider's settings).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Setup">
    Click "Import" to finalize the configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Assigning Agents to Phone Numbers

After importing your SIP trunk phone number, you can assign it to a conversational AI agent:

1. Go to the Phone Numbers section in the Conversational AI dashboard
2. Select your imported SIP trunk phone number
3. Click "Assign Agent"
4. Select the agent you want to handle calls to this number

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Connection Issues">
    If you're experiencing connection problems:
    1. Verify your SIP trunk configuration on both the ElevenLabs side and your provider side
    2. Check that your firewall allows SIP traffic on port 5060
    3. Confirm that your termination URI is correctly formatted
    4. Test with and without authentication credentials
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Authentication Failures">
    If calls are failing due to authentication issues: 
    1. Double-check your username and password if using digest authentication 
    2. Verify that ElevenLabs' IP addresses are allowlisted if using ACL authentication 
    3. Check your SIP trunk provider's logs for specific authentication error messages
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Audio Quality Issues">
    If you experience poor audio quality: 
    1. Ensure your network has sufficient bandwidth (at least 100 Kbps per call) 
    2. Check for network congestion or packet loss
    3. Verify that your SIP trunk provider supports high-quality codecs

## Limitations and Considerations

- Support for multiple concurrent calls depends on your subscription tier
- Call recording and analytics features are available but may require additional configuration
- Outbound calling capabilities may be limited by your SIP trunk provider
