title: SIP trunking
subtitle: Connect your existing phone system with ElevenLabs conversational AI agents using SIP trunking
---

## Overview

SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) trunking allows you to connect your existing telephony infrastructure directly to ElevenLabs conversational AI agents.
This integration enables enterprise customers to use their existing phone systems while leveraging ElevenLabs' advanced voice AI capabilities.

With SIP trunking, you can:

- Connect your Private Branch Exchange (PBX) or SIP-enabled phone system to ElevenLabs' voice AI platform
- Route calls to AI agents without changing your existing phone infrastructure
- Handle both inbound and outbound calls

## How SIP trunking works

SIP trunking establishes a direct connection between your telephony infrastructure and the ElevenLabs platform:

1. **Inbound calls**: Calls from your SIP trunk are routed to the ElevenLabs platform using your configured SIP INVITE address.
2. **Outbound calls**: Calls initiated by ElevenLabs are routed to your SIP trunk using your configured hostname, enabling your agents to make outgoing calls.
3. **Authentication**: Connection security for the signaling is maintained through either digest authentication (username/password) or Access Control List (ACL) authentication based on the signaling source IP.
4. **Signaling and Media**: The initial call setup (signaling) can use either TCP or UDP based on your transport selection. Once the call is established, the actual audio data (RTP stream) is transmitted over UDP for low latency.

## Requirements

Before setting up SIP trunking, ensure you have:

1. A SIP-compatible PBX or telephony system
2. Phone numbers that you want to connect to ElevenLabs
3. Administrator access to your SIP trunk configuration
4. Appropriate firewall settings to allow SIP traffic
5. **Audio codec compatibility**: Your system must support **48kHz audio** or be capable of resampling audio on your end, as ElevenLabs' SIP deployment outputs and receives audio at this sample rate. This is independent of any audio format configured on the agent for direct websocket connections.

## Setting up SIP trunking

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Phone Numbers">
    Go to the [Phone Numbers section](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/phone-numbers) in the ElevenLabs Conversational AI dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import SIP Trunk">
    Click on "Import a phone number from SIP trunk" button to open the configuration dialog.

    <Frame background="subtle">
      <img src="/assets/images/conversational-ai/sip-trunk.png" alt="SIP trunk configuration dialog" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter basic configuration">
    Complete the basic configuration with the following information:

    - **Label**: A descriptive name for the phone number
    - **Phone Number**: The E.164 formatted phone number to connect (e.g., +15551234567)

    <Frame background="subtle">
      <img src="/assets/images/conversational-ai/sip-trunk-inbound.png" alt="SIP trunk basic configuration" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure outbound settings">
    Configure where ElevenLabs should send calls for your phone number:

    - **Address**: Hostname or IP address where the SIP INVITE is sent (e.g., `sip.telnyx.com`). This should be a hostname or IP address only, not a full SIP URI.
    - **Transport Type**: Select the transport protocol for SIP signaling:
      - **TCP**: Standard TCP transport
      - **UDP**: Standard UDP transport
      - **TLS**: Encrypted TLS transport for enhanced security
    - **Media Encryption**: Configure encryption for RTP media streams:
      - **Allowed**: Permits encrypted media streams
      - **Required**: Enforces encrypted media streams

    <Frame background="subtle">
      <img src="/assets/images/conversational-ai/sip-outbound.png" alt="SIP trunk outbound configuration" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
      The **Address** field specifies where ElevenLabs will send outbound calls from your AI agents. Enter only the hostname or IP address without the `sip:` protocol prefix.
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add custom headers (optional)">
    If your SIP trunk provider requires specific headers for call routing or identification:

    - Click "Add Header" to add custom SIP headers
    - Enter the header name and value as required by your provider
    - You can add multiple headers as needed

    Custom headers are included with all outbound calls and can be used for:
    - Call routing and identification
    - Billing and tracking purposes
    - Provider-specific requirements

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure authentication (optional)">
    Provide digest authentication credentials if required by your SIP trunk provider:

    - **SIP Trunk Username**: Username for SIP digest authentication
    - **SIP Trunk Password**: Password for SIP digest authentication

    If left empty, Access Control List (ACL) authentication will be used, which requires you to allowlist ElevenLabs IP addresses in your provider's settings.

    <Info>
      **Authentication Methods**:
      - **Digest Authentication**: Uses username/password credentials for secure authentication
      - **ACL Authentication**: Uses IP address allowlisting for access control

      **Digest Authentication is strongly recommended** as it provides better security without relying on IP allowlisting, which can be complex to manage with dynamic IP addresses.
    </Info>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Setup">
    Click "Import" to finalize the configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Assigning Agents to Phone Numbers

After importing your SIP trunk phone number, you can assign it to a conversational AI agent:

1. Go to the Phone Numbers section in the Conversational AI dashboard
2. Select your imported SIP trunk phone number
3. Click "Assign Agent"
4. Select the agent you want to handle calls to this number

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Connection Issues">
    If you're experiencing connection problems: 
    
    1. Verify your SIP trunk configuration on both the ElevenLabs side and your provider side. 
    2. Check that your firewall allows SIP signaling traffic on the configured transport protocol and port
    3. Confirm that your address hostname is correctly formatted and accessible
    4. Test with and without digest authentication credentials
    5. If using TLS transport, ensure your certificates are valid and properly configured
    
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Authentication Failures">
    If calls are failing due to authentication issues:

    1. Double-check your SIP trunk username and password if using digest authentication
    2. If using ACL authentication, ensure your provider is configured to trust signaling traffic from ElevenLabs IP addresses (contact support for current IP ranges)
    3. Check your SIP trunk provider's logs for specific authentication error messages
    4. Verify that custom headers, if configured, match your provider's requirements

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="TLS/Encryption Issues">
    If you're experiencing issues with TLS transport or media encryption:

    1. Verify that your SIP trunk provider supports the selected transport type (TLS)
    2. Check certificate validity and trust chains
    3. Ensure your provider supports the configured media encryption settings
    4. Test with different transport types to isolate the issue

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No Audio or One-Way Audio">
    If the call connects but there's no audio or audio only flows one way:

    1. Verify that your firewall allows UDP traffic for the RTP media stream (typically ports 10000-60000).
    Since these IPs change, ensure the rule is not restricted to specific static IPs.
    2. Check for Network Address Translation (NAT) issues that might be blocking the RTP
    stream.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Audio Quality Issues">
    If you experience poor audio quality:

    1. Ensure your network has sufficient bandwidth (at least
      100 Kbps per call) and low latency/jitter for UDP traffic.
    2. Check for network congestion or packet loss, particularly on the UDP path.
    3. Verify codec settings match on both ends.

  </Accordion>

## Limitations and Considerations

- Support for multiple concurrent calls depends on your subscription tier
- Call recording and analytics features are available but may require additional configuration
- Outbound calling capabilities may be limited by your SIP trunk provider
- **Audio format**: ElevenLabs' SIP deployment outputs and receives audio at **48kHz sample rate**. This is independent of any audio format configured on the agent for direct websocket connections. Your SIP trunk system must either support this format natively or perform resampling to match your system's requirements
