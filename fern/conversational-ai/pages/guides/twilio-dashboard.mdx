## Overview

This guide shows you how to connect a Twilio phone number to your conversational AI agent to handle both inbound and outbound calls.

You will learn to:

- Import an existing Twilio phone number.
- Link it to your agent to handle inbound calls.
- Initiate outbound calls using your agent.

## Phone Number Types & Capabilities

ElevenLabs supports two types of Twilio phone numbers with different capabilities:

### Purchased Twilio Numbers (Full Support)

- **Inbound calls**: Supported - Can receive calls and route them to agents
- **Outbound calls**: Supported - Can make calls using agents
- **Requirements**: Number must be purchased through Twilio and appear in your "Phone Numbers" section

### Verified Caller IDs (Outbound Only)

- **Inbound calls**: Not supported - Cannot receive calls or be assigned to agents
- **Outbound calls**: Supported - Can make calls using agents
- **Requirements**: Number must be verified in Twilio's "Verified Caller IDs" section
- **Use case**: Ideal for using your existing business number for outbound AI calls

Learn more about [verifying caller IDs at scale](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/api/verifying-caller-ids-scale) in Twilio's documentation.

<Note>
  During phone number import, ElevenLabs automatically detects the capabilities of your number based
  on its configuration in Twilio.

## Guide

### Prerequisites

- A [Twilio account](https://twilio.com/).
- Either:
  - A purchased & provisioned Twilio [phone number](https://www.twilio.com/docs/phone-numbers) (for inbound + outbound)
  - OR a [verified caller ID](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/make-calls#verify-your-caller-id) in Twilio (for outbound only)

<Steps>

<Step title="Import a Twilio phone number">

In the Conversational AI dashboard, go to the [**Phone Numbers**](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/phone-numbers) tab.

Next, fill in the following details:

- **Label:** A descriptive name (e.g., `Customer Support Line`).
- **Phone Number:** The Twilio number you want to use.
- **Twilio SID:** Your Twilio Account SID.
- **Twilio Token:** Your Twilio Auth Token.

<Note>

You can find your account SID and auth token [**in the Twilio admin console**](https://www.twilio.com/console).

</Accordion>

<Info>
**Phone Number Detection**: ElevenLabs will automatically detect whether your number supports:
- **Inbound + Outbound**: Numbers purchased through Twilio
- **Outbound Only**: Numbers verified as caller IDs in Twilio

If your number is not found in either category, you'll receive an error asking you to verify it exists in your Twilio account.

</Info>

</Step>

<Step title="Assign your agent (Inbound-capable numbers only)">

If your phone number supports inbound calls, you can assign an agent to handle incoming calls.

<Frame background="subtle">

</Frame>

<Note>
  Numbers that only support outbound calls (verified caller IDs) cannot be assigned to agents and
  will show as disabled in the agent dropdown.
</Note>

</Step>

</Steps>

Test the agent by giving the phone number a call. Your agent is now ready to handle inbound calls and engage with your customers.

<Tip>
  Monitor your first few calls in the [Calls History
  dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/history) to ensure everything is working as
  expected.
</Tip>

## Making Outbound Calls

<Info>
  Both purchased Twilio numbers and verified caller IDs can be used for outbound calls. The outbound
  call button will be disabled for numbers that don't support outbound calling.
</Info>

Your imported Twilio phone number can also be used to initiate outbound calls where your agent calls a specified phone number.

<Steps>

<Step title="Initiate an outbound call">

From the [**Phone Numbers**](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/phone-numbers) tab, locate your imported Twilio number and click the **Outbound call** button.

<Frame background="subtle">
  ![Outbound call button](/assets/images/conversational-ai/outbound-button.png)
</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="Configure the call">

In the Outbound Call modal:

1. Select the agent that will handle the conversation
2. Enter the phone number you want to call
3. Click **Send Test Call** to initiate the call

<Frame background="subtle">
  ![Outbound call configuration](/assets/images/conversational-ai/outbound-modal.png)
</Frame>

</Step>

</Steps>

Once initiated, the recipient will receive a call from your Twilio number. When they answer, your agent will begin the conversation.

<Tip>
  Outbound calls appear in your [Calls History
  dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/history) alongside inbound calls, allowing
  you to review all conversations.
</Tip>

<Note>
  When making outbound calls, your agent will be the initiator of the conversation, so ensure your
  agent has appropriate initial messages configured to start the conversation effectively.
