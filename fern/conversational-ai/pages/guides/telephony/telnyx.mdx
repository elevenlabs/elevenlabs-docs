  Before following this guide, consider reading the [SIP trunking
  guide](/docs/conversational-ai/phone-numbers/sip-trunking) to understand how ElevenLabs supports
  SIP trunks.
</Note>

## Overview

This guide explains how to connect your Telnyx SIP trunks directly to ElevenLabs conversational AI agents. This integration allows you to use your existing Telnyx phone numbers and infrastructure while leveraging ElevenLabs' advanced voice AI capabilities.

## How SIP trunking with Telnyx works

SIP trunking establishes a direct connection between your Telnyx telephony infrastructure and the ElevenLabs platform:

1. **Inbound calls**: Calls from your Telnyx SIP trunk are routed to the ElevenLabs platform using our origination URI. You will configure this in your Telnyx account.
2. **Outbound calls**: Calls initiated by ElevenLabs are routed to your Telnyx SIP trunk using your termination URI, enabling your agents to make outgoing calls.
3. **Authentication**: Connection security is maintained through either digest authentication (username/password) or Access Control List (ACL) authentication.
4. **Signaling and Media**: The initial call setup (signaling) uses TCP. Once the call is established, the actual audio data (RTP stream) is transmitted over UDP.

## Requirements

Before setting up the Telnyx SIP trunk integration, ensure you have:

1. An active ElevenLabs account
2. An active Telnyx account
3. At least one phone number purchased or ported into your Telnyx account
4. Administrator access to your Telnyx portal
5. Appropriate firewall settings to allow SIP and RTP traffic
