  Before following this guide, consider reading the [SIP trunking
  guide](/docs/conversational-ai/phone-numbers/sip-trunking) to understand how ElevenLabs supports
  SIP trunks.
</Note>

## Overview

This guide explains how to connect your Plivo SIP trunks directly to ElevenLabs conversational AI agents.
This integration allows you to use your existing Plivo phone numbers and infrastructure while leveraging ElevenLabs' advanced voice AI capabilities, for both inbound and outbound calls.

## How SIP trunking with Plivo works

SIP trunking establishes a direct connection between your Plivo telephony infrastructure and the ElevenLabs platform:

1.  **Inbound calls**: Calls from your Plivo SIP trunk are routed to the ElevenLabs platform using our origination URI. You will configure this in your Plivo account.
2.  **Outbound calls**: Calls initiated by ElevenLabs are routed to your Plivo SIP trunk using your termination URI, enabling your agents to make outgoing calls.
3.  **Authentication**: Connection security for the signaling is maintained through either digest authentication (username/password) or Access Control List (ACL) authentication based on the signaling source IP from Plivo.
4.  **Signaling and Media**: The initial call setup (signaling) uses TCP. Once the call is established, the actual audio data (RTP stream) is transmitted over UDP.

## Requirements

Before setting up the Plivo SIP trunk integration, ensure you have:

1.  An active Plivo account with SIP trunking enabled
2.  Plivo phone numbers that you want to connect to ElevenLabs
3.  Administrator access to your Plivo account and SIP trunk configuration
4.  Appropriate firewall settings to allow SIP traffic to and from ElevenLabs and Plivo

## Configuring Plivo SIP trunks

This section provides detailed instructions for creating SIP trunks in Plivo before connecting them to ElevenLabs.

### Setting up inbound trunks (calls from Plivo to ElevenLabs)

<Steps>

  <Step title="Access Plivo Console">Sign in to the Plivo Console.</Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Zentrunk Dashboard">
    Go to the Zentrunk Dashboard in your Plivo account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create inbound SIP trunk">
    1. Select "Create New Inbound Trunk" and provide a descriptive name for your trunk. 
    2. Under Trunk Authentication, click "Add New URI". 
    3. Enter the ElevenLabs SIP URI: `sip.rtc.elevenlabs.io` 
    4. Select "Create Trunk" to complete your inbound trunk creation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign phone number to trunk">
    1. Navigate to the Phone Numbers Dashboard and select the number you want to route to your inbound trunk. 
    2. Under Number Configuration, set "Trunk" to your newly created inbound trunk.
    3. Select "Update" to save the configuration.
  </Step>
  
</Steps>

### Setting up outbound trunks (calls from ElevenLabs to Plivo)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Plivo Console">Sign in to the Plivo Console.</Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate to Zentrunk Dashboard">
    Go to the Zentrunk Dashboard in your Plivo account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create outbound SIP trunk">
    1. Select "Create New Outbound Trunk" and provide a descriptive name for your trunk. 
    2. Under Trunk Authentication, click "Add New Credentials List". 
    3. Add a username and password that you'll use to authenticate outbound calls.
    4. Select "Create Credentials List". 5. Save your credentials list and select "Create Trunk" to complete your outbound trunk configuration.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Note your termination URI">
    After creating the outbound trunk, note the termination URI (typically in the format
    `sip:yourusername@yourplivotrunk.sip.plivo.com`). You'll need this information when configuring
    the SIP trunk in ElevenLabs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Once you've set up your Plivo SIP trunk, follow the [SIP trunking
  guide](/docs/conversational-ai/phone-numbers/sip-trunking) to finish the setup ElevenLabs as well.
