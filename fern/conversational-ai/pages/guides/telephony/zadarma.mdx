  SIP trunks.
</Note>

## Overview

This guide explains how to connect your Zadarma virtual phone numbers directly to ElevenLabs conversational AI agents. This integration allows you to use your existing Zadarma phone numbers while leveraging ElevenLabs' advanced voice AI capabilities for both inbound and outbound calls.

Zadarma is a cloud-based VoIP provider that offers virtual phone numbers, SIP trunking, and PBX solutions. With this integration, incoming calls to your Zadarma numbers can be automatically answered by your AI agents.

## How Zadarma integration works

The integration establishes a direct SIP connection between your Zadarma virtual numbers and the ElevenLabs platform:

1. **Inbound calls**: Calls to your Zadarma virtual numbers are forwarded to ElevenLabs using SIP URI configuration in your Zadarma account.
2. **Outbound calls**: Your AI agents can make outgoing calls through Zadarma's SIP trunk using the configured termination URI.
3. **Authentication**: Connection security is maintained through SIP digest authentication using your Zadarma credentials.
4. **Call routing**: Different configurations are available depending on whether you use a PBX system or direct SIP routing.

## Requirements

Before setting up the Zadarma integration, ensure you have:

1. An active Zadarma account with virtual phone numbers
2. SIP credentials for your Zadarma virtual numbers (available in your Zadarma personal account)
3. Administrator access to your Zadarma account settings
4. (Optional) A PBX system if you want to use advanced call routing

## Configuration options

Zadarma integration supports two main configuration scenarios:

### Without PBX (Direct SIP routing)

Direct routing sends calls straight from Zadarma to your ElevenLabs AI agents without intermediate processing.

### With PBX

PBX integration allows for advanced call routing, multiple extensions, and additional telephony features before connecting to ElevenLabs.

## Authentication and Security

### SIP Authentication

Zadarma uses digest authentication for SIP connections. Ensure you have:

- **Valid SIP credentials**: Username and password from your Zadarma account
- **Secure password storage**: Keep your SIP credentials secure and rotate them regularly

### Network Security

- Use TCP transport for SIP signaling as configured in the examples above
- Ensure your firewall allows SIP traffic on the appropriate ports
- Consider using TLS transport for enhanced security if supported by your setup

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Calls not reaching ElevenLabs">
    If inbound calls to your Zadarma number are not reaching your AI agent:

    1. **Verify SIP URI configuration**: Ensure the SIP URI in Zadarma matches the format exactly, including your phone number digits
    2. **Check agent assignment**: Confirm that an AI agent is assigned to your imported phone number in ElevenLabs
    3. **Test SIP credentials**: Verify that your Zadarma SIP username and password are correct
    4. **Review Zadarma logs**: Check your Zadarma account for call logs and error messages
    5. **Network connectivity**: Ensure your network allows outbound SIP traffic to ElevenLabs

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication failures">
    If you're experiencing authentication issues:

    1. **Verify credentials**: Double-check your SIP trunk username and password in both Zadarma and ElevenLabs
    2. **Password generation**: If needed, generate a new SIP password in your Zadarma account
    3. **Case sensitivity**: Ensure credentials are entered with correct case sensitivity
    4. **Special characters**: Check for any special characters in passwords that might need escaping

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="PBX routing issues">
    For PBX-related problems:

    1. **PBX configuration**: Verify your PBX is properly configured to route calls to ElevenLabs
    2. **SIP trunk status**: Check that the SIP trunk between your PBX and ElevenLabs is active
    3. **Routing rules**: Review your PBX routing rules to ensure calls are directed correctly
    4. **Extension mapping**: Verify that extensions or DIDs are properly mapped in your routing configuration

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Audio quality issues">
    If you experience poor audio quality:

    1. **Network bandwidth**: Ensure sufficient bandwidth for voice traffic (at least 100 Kbps per call)
    2. **Codec compatibility**: Verify that audio codecs are compatible between all systems
    3. **Network latency**: Check for high latency or jitter that could affect voice quality
    4. **Firewall configuration**: Ensure RTP traffic is not being blocked or throttled

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

### For Non-PBX Setups

- **Keep credentials secure**: Store your Zadarma SIP credentials securely
- **Monitor call quality**: Regularly test call quality and adjust network settings as needed
- **Update configurations**: Keep your SIP configurations updated when Zadarma or ElevenLabs systems change

### For PBX Setups

- **Plan routing logic**: Carefully design your call routing rules to provide the best customer experience
- **Implement fallback**: Configure fallback options in case the AI agent or ElevenLabs service is unavailable
- **Load balancing**: Consider load balancing if you have high call volumes
- **Call recording**: Ensure compliance with local regulations if recording calls that include AI interactions

## Limitations and Considerations

- **Audio format**: ElevenLabs processes audio at 48kHz sample rate; ensure compatibility with your setup
- **Concurrent calls**: Number of simultaneous calls depends on your ElevenLabs subscription plan
- **Geographic restrictions**: Some Zadarma services may have geographic limitations
- **Emergency services**: AI agents may not be suitable for emergency service calls; configure appropriate routing
