## Overview

Leveraging the HubSpot integration, your agent can interact with your CRM both to retrieve and write relevant information about contacts, interactions, or follow ups.

## How it works

Here is an example of how a Conversational AI agent can interact with your HubSpot CRM using tool calling.
Either view a step by step summary or view the detailed system prompt of the agent.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="High level overview ">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Customer Identification">
        You can configure your agent to ask for an identification item such as email, and prompt it use a tool we called `search_contact` to search your CRM for that email to verify whether this customer exists.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Understand Call Intent">
        Configure the agent to ask about the caller's intent. This can be adapted to meet your particular workflow.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Get previous interactions">
        While previous interactions can also be fetched and passed at the beginning of the conversation (see [Personalization](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/personalization)). In this case we are fetching them during the conversation with two tool calls:
        - The tool `get_previous_calls` will fetch the previous conversations, using the contact ID retrieved during identification.
        - The response does not include the content of those conversations, so we need to use another endpoint to fetch the content with those call IDs.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Ticket Creation">
        - The agent can discuss the issue at hand, relating to previous interactions.
        - Use the `create_ticket` tool to create a ticket for a follow up item
        - Associate the ticket created to the CRM contact
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>

    ```
    # Personality

    You are a customer support agent. You are helpful, efficient, and polite. Your goal is to quickly understand the caller's issue and create a support ticket.

    # Environment

    You are answering a phone call from a customer. You have access to tools to search for customer contact information, previous calls and create tickets.

    # Tone

    You are professional and courteous. You speak clearly and concisely. You use a friendly tone and show empathy for the customer's situation. You confirm information to ensure accuracy.

    # Goal

    Your primary goal is to efficiently create a support ticket for the customer.

    1.  **Verify Identity:** Ask the caller for their email address to verify their identity. Silently use the `search_contact` tool to verify the caller exists. Use their name after this.
    2.  **Understand Issue:** Ask the customer what they are calling about and actively listen to capture their intent.
    3.  **Get previous interactions:**: Silently (without saying you will do it) call get_previous_calls and immediately after call get_call_content with the call ids, to see if previous interactions are relevant to the issue. Ask about their problem, and reference previous conversations if relevant. Use this information with the user.
    4.  **Create Ticket:** If the user wants to report an issue, make a new purchase, or discuss something else, use the `create_ticket` tool to create a ticket with the details of the customer's issue. Extract the description from the conversation.
    5.  **Confirmation:** Confirm the ticket details with the customer and communicate the ticket number to the caller, and mention a dedicated advisor will be in touch.

    # Guardrails

    *   Only use the tools provided.
    *   Do not provide information that is not related to the customer.
    *   Do not ask for personal information beyond what is needed to verify identity.
    *   Remain polite and professional at all times, even if the customer is upset.
    *   If you cannot create a ticket, explain why and offer alternative solutions.

    # Tools

    *   `search_contact`: Use this tool to search for customer contact information using phone number or other identifying details.
    *   `create_ticket`: Use this tool to create a support ticket with the customer's issue. Capture the customer's description of the issue accurately.
    *   `get_previous_calls`: Use this tool to fetch previous interactions with the customer.
    *   `get_call_content`: Use this tool to get the content of the previous interactions with the customer.

<Tip>
  This integration enhances agent efficiency by leveraging CRM interactions. All API calls require
  proper secret handling in the authorization headers.
</Tip>

## Authentication Setup

Before configuring the tools, you must set up authentication with HubSpot.

### Step 1: Generate HubsPot API Token

1. Log into your HubSpot account
2. Navigate to **Account Management → Integrations → Private Apps**
3. Create a **Private App**
4. Add the required scopes to the private app, to ensure it can interact with the required endpoints

```
crm.objects.contacts.read
crm.objects.contacts.write
crm.schemas.contacts.read
crm.schemas.contacts.write
tickets
```

5. Save and get the Access token from the Auth section

### Step 2: Create Authentication Secret

The HubSpot API requires Bearer authentication. You need to create a properly formatted secret:

1. **Create the secret value** by adding "Bearer " prefix:

   ```
   Bearer pat-eu1-12345678-abcdefgh-ijklmnop-qrstuvwx
   ```

2. **Save this as a secret** in your agent's secrets with name `hubspot_key`

## Security Considerations

- Use HTTPS endpoints for all webhook calls.
- Store sensitive values as secrets using the ElevenLabs Secrets Manager.
- Validate that all authorization headers follow the required format.
