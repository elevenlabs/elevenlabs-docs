subtitle: Create real-time, interactive voice conversations with AI agents

<Note>
  This documentation is for developers integrating directly with the ElevenLabs WebSocket API. For
  convenience, consider using [the official SDKs provided by
  ElevenLabs](/docs/conversational-ai/libraries/).
</Note>

The ElevenLabs [Conversational AI](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai) WebSocket API enables real-time, interactive voice conversations with AI agents. By establishing a WebSocket connection, you can send audio input and receive audio responses in real-time, creating life-like conversational experiences.

<Note>Endpoint: `wss://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation?agent_id={agent_id}`</Note>

## Authentication

### Using Agent ID

For public agents, you can directly use the `agent_id` in the WebSocket URL without additional authentication:

```bash
wss://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation?agent_id=<your-agent-id>
```

### Using a Signed URL

For private agents or conversations requiring authorization, obtain a signed URL from your server, which securely communicates with the ElevenLabs API using your API key.

### Example using cURL

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation/get_signed_url?agent_id=<your-agent-id>" \
     -H "xi-api-key: <your-api-key>"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "signed_url": "wss://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation?agent_id=<your-agent-id>&token=<token>"
}
```

<Warning>Never expose your ElevenLabs API key on the client side.</Warning>

## Latency Management

To ensure smooth conversations, implement these strategies:

- **Adaptive Buffering:** Adjust audio buffering based on network conditions.
- **Jitter Buffer:** Implement a jitter buffer to smooth out variations in packet arrival times.
- **Ping-Pong Monitoring:** Use ping and pong events to measure round-trip time and adjust accordingly.

## Security Best Practices

- Rotate API keys regularly and use environment variables to store them.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- Clearly explain the intention when prompting users for microphone access.
- Optimized Chunking: Tweak the audio chunk duration to balance latency and efficiency.
