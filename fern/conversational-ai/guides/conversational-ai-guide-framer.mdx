        Open your website in the Framer editor and click on the primary desktop on the left.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the Conversational AI component">
        Copy and paste the following url into the page you would like to add the Conversational AI agent to:

        ```
        https://framer.com/m/ConversationalAI-TLYB.js@vrSkSPzcAqBl7eEs0YkO
        ```
        You'll now see a Conversational AI asset on the 'Layers' bar on the left and the Conversational AI component's details on the right.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Fill in the agent details">
        Enable the Conversational AI agent by filling in the agent ID in the bar on the right. 
        You can find the agent ID in the [ElevenLabs dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai).

        Your agent's url page is found at https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/agentid
