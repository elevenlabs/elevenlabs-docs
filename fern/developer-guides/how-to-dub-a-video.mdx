## Introduction

Dubbing videos and audio files from one language to another can be a great way to reach a wider audience. The ElevenLabs API provides a convenient way to automatically dub media files using state-of-the-art technology. In this guide, we will walk you through how to upload a video or audio file, dub it, and download the translated video. We'll also discuss how to directly dub a link such as a YouTube, TikTok, or Twitter video.

If you're looking to jump straight into the action, the complete code is available on the following repos:

- [Python example repo](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-examples/tree/main/examples/dubbing/python).

<Tip>
  On the 8th of May 2024 we launched the Dubbing API for all ElevenLabs tiers

## How to upload and dub a video or audio file

### Requirements

Before proceeding, please ensure that you have the following:

- An ElevenLabs account with an API key (hereâ€™s how to [find your API key](/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech#authentication)).
- Python or Node.js installed on your machine

Then, install the ElevenLabs SDK as shown below

<CodeGroup>

```bash Python
pip install elevenlabs
```

</CodeGroup>

Install the necessary packages to manage your environmental variables:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Python
pip install python-dotenv
```

</CodeGroup>

Next, create a `.env` file in your project directory and fill it with your credentials like so:

```bash .env
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
```

### Start the dubbing

First we want to send the file to the ElevenLabs dubbing service

<CodeGroup>

```python Python

def create_dub_from_file(
    input_file_path: str,
    file_format: str,
    source_language: str,
    target_language: str,
) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Dubs an audio or video file from one language to another and saves the output.

    Args:
        input_file_path (str): The file path of the audio or video to dub.
        file_format (str): The file format of the input file.
        source_language (str): The language of the input file.
        target_language (str): The target language to dub into.

    Returns:
        Optional[str]: The file path of the dubbed file or None if operation failed.
    """
    if not os.path.isfile(input_file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"The input file does not exist: {input_file_path}")

    with open(input_file_path, "rb") as audio_file:
        response = client.dubbing.dub_a_video_or_an_audio_file(
            file=(os.path.basename(input_file_path), audio_file, file_format), # Optional file
            target_lang=target_language, # The target language to dub the content into. Can be none if dubbing studio editor is enabled and running manual mode
            mode="automatic", # automatic or manual.
            source_lang=source_language, # Source language
            num_speakers=1, # Number of speakers to use for the dubbing.
            watermark=False,  # Whether to apply watermark to the output video.
        )

    # rest of the code

```

</CodeGroup>

### Check for completion

The `wait_for_dubbing_completion()` function within the `dubbing_utils.py` file polls the API to check whether the dubbing process is complete. If completed, it proceeds to the next step; otherwise, it reports the status or failure.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python

def wait_for_dubbing_completion(dubbing_id: str) -> bool:
    """
    Waits for the dubbing process to complete by periodically checking the status.

    Args:
        dubbing_id (str): The dubbing project id.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the dubbing is successful, False otherwise.
    """
    MAX_ATTEMPTS = 120
    CHECK_INTERVAL = 10  # In seconds

    for _ in range(MAX_ATTEMPTS):
        metadata = client.dubbing.get_dubbing_project_metadata(dubbing_id)
        if metadata.status == "dubbed":
            return True
        elif metadata.status == "dubbing":
            print(
                "Dubbing in progress... Will check status again in",
                CHECK_INTERVAL,
                "seconds.",
            )
            time.sleep(CHECK_INTERVAL)
        else:
            print("Dubbing failed:", metadata.error_message)
            return False

    print("Dubbing timed out")
    return False

```

</CodeGroup>

### Save the video locally

Upon completion of dubbing, the `download_dubbed_file()` function in `dubbing_utils.py` will save the dubbed file to a local directory, typically under the `data/{dubbing_id}/{language_code}.mp4`.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python

def download_dubbed_file(dubbing_id: str, language_code: str) -> str:
    """
    Downloads the dubbed file for a given dubbing ID and language code.

    Args:
        dubbing_id: The ID of the dubbing project.
        language_code: The language code for the dubbing.

    Returns:
        The file path to the downloaded dubbed file.
    """
    dir_path = f"data/{dubbing_id}"
    os.makedirs(dir_path, exist_ok=True)

    file_path = f"{dir_path}/{language_code}.mp4"
    with open(file_path, "wb") as file:
        for chunk in client.dubbing.get_dubbed_file(dubbing_id, language_code):
            file.write(chunk)

    return file_path

```

</CodeGroup>

### Putting it together

We add the `wait_for_dubbing_completion`(`waitForDubbingCompletion`) function and the `download_dubbed_file`(`downloadDubbedFile`) function together to create the final function.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
def create_dub_from_file(
    input_file_path: str,
    file_format: str,
    source_language: str,
    target_language: str,
) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Dubs an audio or video file from one language to another and saves the output.

    Args:
        input_file_path (str): The file path of the audio or video to dub.
        file_format (str): The file format of the input file.
        source_language (str): The language of the input file.
        target_language (str): The target language to dub into.

    Returns:
        Optional[str]: The file path of the dubbed file or None if operation failed.
    """
    if not os.path.isfile(input_file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"The input file does not exist: {input_file_path}")

    with open(input_file_path, "rb") as audio_file:
        response = client.dubbing.dub_a_video_or_an_audio_file(
            file=(os.path.basename(input_file_path), audio_file, file_format),
            target_lang=target_language,
            mode="automatic",
            source_lang=source_language,
            num_speakers=1,
            watermark=False,  # reduces the characters used if enabled, only works for videos not audio
        )

    dubbing_id = response.dubbing_id
    if wait_for_dubbing_completion(dubbing_id):
        output_file_path = download_dubbed_file(dubbing_id, target_language)
        return output_file_path
    else:
        return None

```

</CodeGroup>

We then use the final the function as shown below.

<CodeGroup>

```python create_a_dub_from_file.py (Python)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = create_dub_from_file(
        "../example_speech.mp3",  # Input file path
        "audio/mpeg",  # File format
        "en",  # Source language
        "es",  # Target language
    )
    if result:
        print("Dubbing was successful! File saved at:", result)
    else:
        print("Dubbing failed or timed out.")

```

</CodeGroup>

## How to dub a video from YouTube, TikTok, Twitter or Vimeo

For dubbing web-based content, instead of uploading a file you can pass in a URL. This supports popular platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, and Vimeo.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python

def create_dub_from_url(
    source_url: str,
    source_language: str,
    target_language: str,
) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Downloads a video from a URL, and creates a dubbed version in the target language.

    Args:
        source_url (str): The URL of the source video to dub. Can be a YouTube link, TikTok, X (Twitter) or a Vimeo link.
        source_language (str): The language of the source video.
        target_language (str): The target language to dub into.

    Returns:
        Optional[str]: The file path of the dubbed file or None if operation failed.
    """

    response = client.dubbing.dub_a_video_or_an_audio_file(
      source_url=source_url, # URL of the source video/audio file.
      target_lang=target_language, # The Target language to dub the content into. Can be none if dubbing studio editor is enabled and running manual mode
      mode="automatic", # automatic or manual.
      source_lang=source_language, # Source language.
      num_speakers=1, # Number of speakers to use for the dubbing.
      watermark=True,  # Whether to apply watermark to the output video.
    )

    dubbing_id = response.dubbing_id
    if wait_for_dubbing_completion(dubbing_id):
        output_file_path = download_dubbed_file(dubbing_id, target_language)
        return output_file_path
    else:
        return None

```

</CodeGroup>

You can then call the function as shown below.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    source_url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EqSXDwTq6U"  # Charlie bit my finger
    source_language = "en"
    target_language = "fr"
    result = create_dub_from_url(source_url, source_language, target_language)
    if result:
        print("Dubbing was successful! File saved at:", result)
    else:
        print("Dubbing failed or timed out.")

```

</CodeGroup>
