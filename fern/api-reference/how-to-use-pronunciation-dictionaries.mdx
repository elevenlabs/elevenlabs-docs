  How to add, view, and remove rules to pronunciation dictionaries with the
  Python SDK
slug: api-reference/how-to-use-pronunciation-dictionaries
---


In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use a pronunciation dictionary with the ElevenLabs Python SDK. Pronunciation dictionaries are useful for controlling the specific pronunciation of words. We support both [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) and [CMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMU_Pronouncing_Dictionary) alphabets. It is useful for correcting rare or specific pronunciations, such as names or companies. For example, the word `nginx` could be pronounced incorrectly. Instead, we can add our version of pronunciation. Based on IPA, `nginx` is pronounced as `/ˈɛndʒɪnˈɛks/`. Finding IPA or CMU of words manually can be difficult. Instead, LLMs like ChatGPT can help you to make the search easier.

We'll start by adding rules to the pronunciation dictionary from a file and comparing the text-to-speech results that use and do not use the dictionary. After that, we'll discuss how to add and remove specific rules to existing dictionaries.

If you want to jump straight to the finished repo you can find it [here](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-examples/tree/main/examples/pronunciation-dictionaries/python)

<Info>
  Alias tags are supported by all models. Phoneme tags only work with the models
  `eleven_turbo_v2` and `eleven_monolingual_v1`. If you use phoneme tags with
  other models, they will silently skip the word.

## Requirements

- An ElevenLabs account with an API key (here’s how to [find your API key](/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech#authentication)).
- Python installed on your machine
- FFMPEG to play audio

## Setup

### Installing our SDK

Before you begin, make sure you have installed the necessary SDKs and libraries. You will need the ElevenLabs SDK for the updating pronunciation dictionary and using text-to-speech conversion. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install elevenlabs
```

Additionally, install `python-dotenv` to manage your environmental variables:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

Next, create a `.env` file in your project directory and fill it with your credentials like so:

```
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
```

## Initiate the Client SDK

We'll start by initializing the client SDK.

```python
import os
from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs

ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = os.getenv("ELEVENLABS_API_KEY")
client = ElevenLabs(
    api_key=ELEVENLABS_API_KEY,
)
```

## Create a Pronunciation Dictionary From a File

To create a pronunciation dictionary from a File, we'll create a `.pls` file for our rules.

This rule will use the "IPA" alphabet and update the pronunciation for `tomato` and `Tomato` with a different pronunciation. PLS files are case sensitive which is why we include it both with and without a capital "T". Save it as `dictionary.pls`.

```xml title="dictionary.pls"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<lexicon version="1.0"
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/01/pronunciation-lexicon"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.w3.org/2005/01/pronunciation-lexicon
        http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/CR-pronunciation-lexicon-20071212/pls.xsd"
      alphabet="ipa" xml:lang="en-US">
  <lexeme>
    <grapheme>tomato</grapheme>
    <phoneme>/tə'meɪtoʊ/</phoneme>
  </lexeme>
  <lexeme>
    <grapheme>Tomato</grapheme>
    <phoneme>/tə'meɪtoʊ/</phoneme>
  </lexeme>
</lexicon>
```

In the following snippet, we start by adding rules from a file and get the uploaded result. Finally, we generate and play two different text-to-speech audio to compare the custom pronunciation dictionary.

```python
import requests
from elevenlabs import play, PronunciationDictionaryVersionLocator

with open("dictionary.pls", "rb") as f:
    # this dictionary changes how tomato is pronounced
    pronunciation_dictionary = client.pronunciation_dictionary.add_from_file(
        file=f.read(), name="example"
    )

audio_1 = client.generate(
    text="Without the dictionary: tomato",
    voice="Rachel",
    model="eleven_turbo_v2",
)

audio_2 = client.generate(
    text="With the dictionary: tomato",
    voice="Rachel",
    model="eleven_turbo_v2",
    pronunciation_dictionary_locators=[
        PronunciationDictionaryVersionLocator(
            pronunciation_dictionary_id=pronunciation_dictionary.id,
            version_id=pronunciation_dictionary.version_id,
        )
    ],
)

# play the audio
play(audio_1)
play(audio_2)
```

## Remove Rules From a Pronunciation Dictionary

To remove rules from a pronunciation dictionary, we can simply call `remove_rules_from_the_pronunciation_dictionary` method in the pronunciation dictionary module. In the following snippet, we start by removing rules based on the rule string and get the updated result. Finally, we generate and play another text-to-speech audio to test the difference. In the example, we take pronunciation dictionary version id from `remove_rules_from_the_pronunciation_dictionary` response because every changes to pronunciation dictionary will create a new version, so we need to use the latest version returned from the response. The old version also still available.

```python
pronunciation_dictionary_rules_removed = (
    client.pronunciation_dictionary.remove_rules_from_the_pronunciation_dictionary(
        pronunciation_dictionary_id=pronunciation_dictionary.id,
        rule_strings=["tomato", "Tomato"],
    )
)

audio_3 = client.generate(
    text="With the rule removed: tomato",
    voice="Rachel",
    model="eleven_turbo_v2",
    pronunciation_dictionary_locators=[
        PronunciationDictionaryVersionLocator(
            pronunciation_dictionary_id=pronunciation_dictionary_rules_removed.id,
            version_id=pronunciation_dictionary_rules_removed.version_id,
        )
    ],
)

play(audio_3)
```

## Add Rules to Pronunciation Dictionary

We can add rules directly to the pronunciation dictionary with `PronunciationDictionaryRule_Phoneme` class and call `add_rules_to_the_pronunciation_dictionary` from the pronunciation dictionary. The snippet will demonstrate adding rules with the class and get the updated result. Finally, we generate and play another text-to-speech audio to test the difference. This example also use pronunciation dictionary version returned from `add_rules_to_the_pronunciation_dictionary` to ensure we use the latest dictionary version.

```python
from elevenlabs import PronunciationDictionaryRule_Phoneme

pronunciation_dictionary_rules_added = client.pronunciation_dictionary.add_rules_to_the_pronunciation_dictionary(
    pronunciation_dictionary_id=pronunciation_dictionary_rules_removed.id,
    rules=[
        PronunciationDictionaryRule_Phoneme(
            type="phoneme",
            alphabet="ipa",
            string_to_replace="tomato",
            phoneme="/tə'meɪtoʊ/",
        ),
        PronunciationDictionaryRule_Phoneme(
            type="phoneme",
            alphabet="ipa",
            string_to_replace="Tomato",
            phoneme="/tə'meɪtoʊ/",
        ),
    ],
)

audio_4 = client.generate(
    text="With the rule added again: tomato",
    voice="Rachel",
    model="eleven_turbo_v2",
    pronunciation_dictionary_locators=[
        PronunciationDictionaryVersionLocator(
            pronunciation_dictionary_id=pronunciation_dictionary_rules_added.id,
            version_id=pronunciation_dictionary_rules_added.version_id,
        )
    ],
)

play(audio_4)
```
