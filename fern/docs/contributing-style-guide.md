# ElevenLabs Documentation — Style Guide

We welcome contributions to the ElevenLabs docs, however do ask that you read this guide carefully before submitting pull requests.


## Tone & Voice

### Professional tone
Clear, direct and helpful - without being too casual or too stiff.

❌ **Bad:**
"ElevenLabs has many awesome audio tools!"

✅ **Good**
"ElevenLabs provides a comprehensive suite of audio AI products."

### User-centric
Always assume you're guiding a user who might be new to the platform.

❌ **Bad:**
"Use your API key to make requests"

✅ **Good**
"First, generate an API key in the Dashboard, then use it to authenticate your requests."

## Grammar & Punctuation

### Active voice
Always use the active voice when describing user actions.

❌ **Bad:**
"The save button should be clicked."

✅ **Good**
"Click the 'Save' button."

### Consistent punctuation
End full sentences in lists with periods. Keep lists and steps crisp. Don't use exclamation points.

❌ **Bad:**
- First item in a list
- Second item in a list, which is a long paragraph of text describing how to perform an action in detail, that also is a run-on sentence which makes it hard to read, or understand what information is being conveyed
- Third item!

✅ **Good**
- First item in a list.
- Second item in a list, with a short descriptor.
- Third item.

## Branding
Use the ElevenLabs name and brand consistently.

❌ **Bad:**
Eleven Labs
elevenlabs
11 labs
eleven

✅ **Good**
ElevenLabs

## Structure & Formatting
- **Headings**: Break content into clear sections (H2, H3).
- **Callouts**: Use them to convey important information, warnings or gotchas.
- **Step-by-step guides**: Numbered steps for processes, short and focused.
- **Code snippets**: Always use formatted code blocks, not inline code for long examples.
- **Visual aids**: Include screenshots or illustrations when they help clarify a concept.

# Do's

| Do | Example |
|:---|:---|
| **Be concise and clear** | **Good**: "Click 'Generate Voice' to create a new sample." <br> **Bad**: "You may want to generate a sample, which you can do by using the Generate Voice option, located somewhere on the interface." |
| **Use consistent terminology** | Always call it "**Voice Settings**" — don't mix terms like "**Voice Options**" or "**Audio Config**". |
| **Provide context** | "Use 'Stability' to control how consistently your generated voice sounds across different texts." |
| **Encourage exploration** | "Feel free to experiment with the 'Clarity + Similarity Enhancement' slider to achieve the sound you prefer." |

# Don'ts

| Don't | Example |
|:---|:---|
| **Avoid ambiguity** | **Bad**: "Use the feature to improve quality." <br> → **Better**: "Use the 'Enhancement' setting to make voices sound clearer and more natural." |
| **Don't assume prior knowledge** | **Bad**: "Configure your API to authenticate." <br> → **Better**: "First, generate an API key in the Dashboard, then use it to authenticate your requests." |
| **Refrain from overloading with information** | **Bad**: Long paragraph combining setup, troubleshooting, and advanced usage. <br> → **Better**: Break into three small sections: "Setup," "Troubleshooting," "Advanced Settings." |
| **Avoid passive language** | **Bad**: "The voice is selected by the user." <br> → **Better**: "Select your desired voice from the dropdown menu." |
