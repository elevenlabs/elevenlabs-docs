# ElevenLabs Documentation — Style Guide

We welcome contributions to the ElevenLabs docs, however do ask that you read this guide carefully before submitting pull requests.

## Tone & Voice

### Professional tone

Clear, direct and helpful - without being too casual or too stiff.

**Bad:**
"ElevenLabs has many awesome audio tools!"

**Good**
"ElevenLabs provides a comprehensive suite of audio AI products."

### User-centric

Always assume you're guiding a user who might be new to the platform.

**Bad:**
"Use your API key to make requests"

**Good**
"First, generate an API key in the Dashboard, then use it to authenticate your requests."

### Use consistent terminology

Once defined, use the same terminology throughout.

**Bad:**
Mixing terms like "Voice Settings", "Voice Options" and "Audio Config".

**Good**
Always use "Voice Settings"

### Be concise and clear

**Bad**
"You may want to generate a sample, which you can do by using the Generate Voice option, located somewhere on the interface."

**Good**
"Click 'Generate Voice' to create a new sample."

### Avoid ambiguity.

**Bad**
"Use the feature to improve quality."

**Good**
"Use the 'Enhancement' setting to make voices sound clearer and more natural."

### Refrain from overloading with information

**Bad**
Long paragraph combining setup, troubleshooting, and advanced usage.

**Good**
Break into three small sections: "Setup," "Troubleshooting," "Advanced Settings."

## Grammar & Punctuation

### Active voice

Always use the active voice when describing user actions.

**Bad:**
"The voice is selected by the user."

**Good**
"Select your desired voice from the dropdown menu."

### Consistent punctuation

End full sentences in lists with periods. Keep lists and steps crisp. Don't use exclamation points or emojis.

**Bad:**

- first item with no punctuation
- Second item in a list, which is a long paragraph of text describing how to perform an action in detail, that also is a run-on sentence which makes it hard to read, or understand what information is being conveyed
- ✍️ Third item with emoji and exclamation point!

**Good**

- First item in a list.
- Second item in a list, with a short descriptor.
- Third item in a list.

## Branding

Use the ElevenLabs name and brand correctly.

**Bad:**
Eleven Labs
elevenlabs
11 labs
eleven

**Good**
ElevenLabs

## Structure & Formatting

- **Headings**: Break content into clear sections (H2, H3).
- **Callouts**: Use them to convey important information, warnings or gotchas.
- **Step-by-step guides**: Numbered steps for processes, short and focused.
- **Code snippets**: Always use formatted code blocks, not inline code for long examples.
- **Visual aids**: Include screenshots or illustrations when they help clarify a concept.
