### Text to speech

- **A-law format support**: Added [a-law format](/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech/convert#request.query.output_format) with 8kHz sample rate to enable integration with European telephony systems.
- **Fixed quota issues**: Fixed a database bug that caused some requests to be mistakenly rejected as exceeding their quota.

### Conversational AI

- **Document type filtering**: Added support for filtering knowledge base documents by their [type](/docs/api-reference/knowledge-base/get-knowledge-base-list#request.query.types) (file, URL, or text).
- **Non-audio agents**: Added support for conversational agents that don't output audio but still send response transcripts and can use tools. Non-audio agents can be enabled by removing the audio [client event](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/events/client-events).
- **Improved agent templates**: Updated all agent templates with enhanced configurations and prompts. See more about how to improve system prompts [here](/docs/conversational-ai/best-practices/prompting-guide)
- **Fixed stuck exports**: Fixed an issue that caused exports to be stuck for extended periods.

### Studio

- **Fixed volume normalization**: Fixed issue with streaming project snapshots when volume normalization is enabled.

### New API endpoints

- **Forced alignment**: Added new [forced alignment](/docs/api-reference/forced-alignment) endpoint for aligning audio with text, perfect for subtitle generation.
- **Batch calling**: Added batch calling [endpoint](/docs/api-reference/conversations/create-batch-call) for scheduling calls to multiple recipients
