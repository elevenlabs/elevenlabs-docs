## Speech to text

- **`scribe_v1_experimental`**: Launched a new experimental preview of the [Scribe v1 model](/docs/capabilities/speech-to-text) with improvements including improved performance on audio files with multiple languages, reduced hallucinations when audio is interleaved with silence, and improved audio tags. The new model is available via the API under the model name [`scribe_v1_experimental`](/docs/api-reference/speech-to-text/convert#request.body.model_id)

### Text to speech

- **A-law format support**: Added [a-law format](/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech/convert#request.query.output_format) with 8kHz sample rate to enable integration with European telephony systems.
- **Fixed quota issues**: Fixed a database bug that caused some requests to be mistakenly rejected as exceeding their quota.

### Conversational AI

- **Document type filtering**: Added support for filtering knowledge base documents by their [type](/docs/api-reference/knowledge-base/get-knowledge-base-list#request.query.types) (file, URL, or text).
- **Non-audio agents**: Added support for conversational agents that don't output audio but still send response transcripts and can use tools. Non-audio agents can be enabled by removing the audio [client event](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/events/client-events).
- **Improved agent templates**: Updated all agent templates with enhanced configurations and prompts. See more about how to improve system prompts [here](/docs/conversational-ai/best-practices/prompting-guide).
- **Fixed stuck exports**: Fixed an issue that caused exports to be stuck for extended periods.

### Studio

- **Fixed volume normalization**: Fixed issue with streaming project snapshots when volume normalization is enabled.

### New API endpoints

- **Forced alignment**: Added new [forced alignment](/docs/api-reference/forced-alignment) endpoint for aligning audio with text, perfect for subtitle generation.
- **Batch calling**: Added batch calling [endpoint](/docs/conversational-ai/api-reference/batch-calling/create) for scheduling calls to multiple recipients
