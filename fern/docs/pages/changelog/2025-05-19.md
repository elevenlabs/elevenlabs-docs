### Speech to Text

- **Speech to Text logprobs**: The Speech to Text response now includes a `logprob` field for word prediction confidence.

### Billing

- **Improved API Error Messages**: Enhanced API error messages for subscriptions with failed payments. This provides clearer information if a failed payment has caused a user to reach their quota threshold sooner than expected.

### Conversational AI

- **Batch calls**: Released new batch calling functionality, which allows you to automate groups of outbound calls.
- **Increased Evaluation Criteria Limit**: The maximum number of evaluation criteria for agent performance evaluation has been increased from 5 to 10.
- **Human-Readable IDs**: Introduced human-readable IDs for key Conversational AI entities (e.g., agents, conversations). This improves usability and makes resources easier to identify and manage through the API and UI.
- **Unanswered Call Tracking**: 'Not Answered' outbound calls are now reliably detected and visible in the conversation history.
- **LLM Cost Visibility in Dashboard**: The Conversational AI dashboard now displays the total and per-minute average LLM costs.
- **Zero Retention Mode (ZRM) for Agents**: Allowed enabling Zero Retention Mode (ZRM) [per agent](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/privacy/zrm).
- **Dynamic variables in headers**: Added option of setting dynamic variable as a header value for tools.
- **Customisable tool timeouts**: Shipped setting different [timeout durations per tool](/docs/api-reference/agents/create-agent#request.body.conversation_config.agent.prompt.tools.client.response_timeout_secs).

### Workspaces

- **Simplified Secret Updates**: Workspace secrets can now be updated more granularly using a `PATCH` request via the API, simplifying the management of individual secret values. For technical details, please see the API changes section below.

### SDKs

Released new v2 SDKs in both [Python](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-python) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js)
