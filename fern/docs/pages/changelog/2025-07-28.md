### Workspaces

- **Service account API key management**: Added comprehensive API endpoints for managing service account API keys, including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion capabilities. See [Service Accounts documentation](/docs/product-guides/administration/workspaces/service-accounts).

### Conversational AI

- **Post-call webhook migration**: The post call webhook format is being migrated so that webhook handlers can be auto generated in the SDKs. This is not a breaking change, and no further action is required if your current handler accepts additional fields. Please see more information [here](docs/conversational-ai/workflows/post-call-webhooks#migration-notice-enhanced-webhook-format).
- **Agent transfer improvements**: Fixed system variable `system_agent_id` to properly update after agent-to-agent transfers, ensuring accurate conversation context tracking. Added new `system_current_agent_id` variable for tracking current active agent. Learn more about [dynamic variables](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/personalization/dynamic-variables#system-dynamic-variables).
- **Enhanced public agent page**: Added text input functionality and dynamic variable support to the public talk-to-agent page. You can now pass dynamic variables via URL parameters (e.g., `?var_username=value`) and use text input during voice conversations. See [dynamic variables guide](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/personalization/dynamic-variables#public-talk-to-page-integration).
- **Voicemail detection**: Added voicemail detection as a built-in tool for conversational AI agents to improve call handling. Learn about [voicemail detection](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools/system-tools/voicemail-detection).
- **Conversation filtering**: Added `user_id` query parameter to [conversation list endpoint](/docs/conversational-ai/api-reference/conversations/list#request.query.user_id.user_id) for filtering conversations by initiating user.

### Speech to Text

- **Multi-channel transcription**: Added `use_multi_channel` parameter to transcription endpoint for processing audio files with multiple speakers on separate channels. Supports up to 5 channels with per-channel transcription results. See [multichannel guide](/docs/cookbooks/speech-to-text/multichannel-transcription).

### Studio

- **Caption support**: Added caption functionality to Studio projects with new `captions_enabled` and `caption_style` properties for both podcasts and general projects. Learn more about [Studio](/docs/product-guides/products/studio).
