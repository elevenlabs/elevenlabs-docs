### SDKs

- **Python SDK**: Released [v2.6.1](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-python/releases) with critical bug fix for Conversational AI contextual updates. Fixed validation error that was preventing `send_contextual_update()` calls from working properly due to missing `text` field requirement.
