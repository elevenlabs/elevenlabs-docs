### Speech to Text

- **Webhook support**: Added asynchronous processing option with webhook delivery. Set the `webhook` parameter to `true` to receive transcription results via [configured webhooks](/docs/api-reference/speech-to-text/convert#request.body.webhook.webhook) instead of waiting for synchronous response.

### Conversational AI

- **Claude Sonnet 4 support**: Added [Claude Sonnet 4 as a new LLM option](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/llm#anthropic) for conversational agents, providing enhanced reasoning capabilities and improved performance.
- **Genesys Cloud integration**: Introduced AudioHook Protocol integration for seamless connection with [Genesys Cloud contact center platform](/docs/conversational-ai/phone-numbers/c-caa-s-integrations/genesys).
- **Multi-voice support for agents**: Enable conversational AI agents to [dynamically switch between different voices](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/voice/multi-voice) during conversations for multi-character storytelling, language tutoring, and role-playing scenarios.
- **Force delete knowledge base documents**: Added [`force` parameter](/docs/api-reference/knowledge-base/delete#request.query.force.force) to knowledge base document deletion, allowing removal of documents even when used by agents.
- **Improved widget configuration**: Enhanced text input and text-only mode defaults for better user experience with [improved widget configuration](/docs/api-reference/widget/get#response.body.widget_config.supports_text_only).
