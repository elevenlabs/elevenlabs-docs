### Conversational AI

- **HIPAA Compliance**: [Gemini 2.5 Flash is now available for HIPAA customers](/docs/conversational-ai/legal/hipaa), providing enhanced AI capabilities while maintaining strict healthcare compliance standards.

- **Post-call Audio**: Added support for returning call audio in [post-call webhooks](/docs/conversational-ai/workflows/post-call-webhooks), enabling comprehensive conversation analysis and quality assurance workflows.

- **Enhanced Widget**: Added additional [text customization options](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/widget) including start chat button text, chatting status text, and input placeholders for text-only and new conversations.

- **Agent Transfers**: Improved [agent transfer capabilities](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools/agent-transfer) with transfer delay configuration, custom transfer messages, and control over transferred agent first message behavior.

- **SIP Trunk Enhancements**: Added support for separate inbound and outbound [SIP trunk configurations](/docs/conversational-ai/phone-numbers/sip-trunking) with enhanced access control and transfer options.

### Dubbing

- **API Schema Update**: Updated our API documentation to explicitly require the `target_language` parameter for [dubbing projects](/docs/capabilities/dubbing). This parameter has always been required - we're just making it clearer in our docs. No code changes needed.

- **Duration Validation**: Added validation to ensure calculated duration makes sense, preventing zero-credit charges for invalid audio uploads.

### Speech to Text

- **Deterministic Sampling**: Added `seed` parameter support for deterministic sampling, enabling reproducible [speech-to-text results](/docs/capabilities/speech-to-text).

### Forced Alignment

- **Confidence Scoring**: Added confidence scoring with `loss` field for words and overall transcript accuracy assessment using [forced alignment](/docs/capabilities/forced-alignment).

### Usage Analytics

- **Workspace Breakdown**: Added reporting workspace ID breakdown for character usage statistics, providing detailed usage insights across [workspaces](/docs/product-guides/administration/workspaces/overview).

### SDKs

- **React Conversational AI SDK**: Released [v0.2.0](https://github.com/elevenlabs/packages/releases/tag/%40elevenlabs%2Freact%400.2.0) with support for Indian data residency and WebRTC mode for Conversational AI.
- **Python SDK**: Released [v2.6.1](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-python/releases) with enhanced Conversational AI capabilities and bug fixes.
- **JavaScript SDK**: Released [v2.5.0](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js/releases) with improved Conversational AI SDK support and new features.

### API

<Accordion title="View API changes">

## Deprecations

- `POST /v1/convai/phone-numbers/create` has been deprecated in favor of [POST /v1/convai/phone-numbers](/docs/api-reference/phone-numbers/create). Please note that migrating to the new endpoint requires a few adjustments:
  - Replace `provider_config` field with `inbound_trunk` and `outbound_trunk` for SIP trunk configurations
  - Update response parsing to handle the new trunk configuration structure

### Schema Removals

- Removed `SIPTrunkConfigResponseModel`, `SIPTrunkCredentials`, `TransferToNumberToolConfig`
- Removed `incomplete_expired` and `canceled` subscription statuses

## New Features

### Enhanced SIP Trunk Support

- [SIP trunk configuration](/docs/conversational-ai/phone-numbers/sip-trunking) now uses separate inbound and outbound trunk configs instead of single configuration
- Deprecated `provider_config` field in SIP trunk response from [the new endpoint](/docs/api-reference/phone-numbers/create) (replaced with `inbound_trunk` and `outbound_trunk`)
- Inbound trunk access control with allowed addresses and phone numbers
- SIP URI transfer destinations alongside phone number transfers
- Transfer to number improvements (conference or SIP refer)

### Agent Transfers

- [Transfer delay configuration](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools/agent-transfer) with `delay_ms`
- Custom transfer messages
- Control over transferred agent first message behavior

### Conversation Enhancements

- ElevenLabs Assistant integration tracking
- User ID tracking for conversation participants and initiators
- Audio data in [post-call webhooks](/docs/conversational-ai/workflows/post-call-webhooks) (configurable)
- [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/mcp) tool call details in conversation history

### Widget Improvements

- Additional [text customization options](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/widget):
  - Start chat button text
  - Chatting status text
  - Input placeholders for text-only and new conversations

### API Improvements

#### Speech to Text

- Added deterministic sampling with `seed` parameter in [Convert speech to text](/docs/api-reference/speech-to-text/convert)

#### Forced Alignment

- Added confidence scoring with `loss` field for words and overall transcript in [Forced alignment](/docs/api-reference/forced-alignment/create)

#### Usage Analytics

- Added reporting workspace ID breakdown for character stats in [Get characters usage metrics](/docs/api-reference/usage/get)

#### Tool Configuration

- [Client tool](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools/client-tools) response timeout increased from 30 to 120 seconds

#### Workspace Resources

- Added agent response tests resource type

## Deprecations

- Phone number `provider_config` field (use `inbound_trunk`/`outbound_trunk` instead)
- `phone_number` field in transfer configurations (use `transfer_destination` instead)
