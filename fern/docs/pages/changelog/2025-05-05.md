### Dubbing

- **Audio Length Validation**: The Dubbing API will now return an error if the provided audio file is too short (less than 1 second). This improves error handling for invalid inputs. See the [Create Dub](/docs/api-reference/dubbing/dub-a-video-or-an-audio-file) endpoint.
- **Disable Voice Cloning**: Added an option in the Dubbing Studio UI to disable voice cloning when uploading audio, aligning with the existing `disable_voice_cloning` API parameter.

### Billing

- **Quota Exceeded Error**: Improved error messaging for exceeding character limits. Users attempting to generate audio beyond their quota within a short billing window will now receive a clearer `401 unauthorized` error message indicating the limit has been exceeded.
