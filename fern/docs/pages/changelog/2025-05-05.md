### Dubbing

- **Disable Voice Cloning**: Added an option in the [Dubbing Studio UI](https://elevenlabs.io/app/dubbing) to disable voice cloning when uploading audio, aligning with the existing `disable_voice_cloning` API parameter.

### Billing

- **Quota Exceeded Error**: Improved error messaging for exceeding character limits. Users attempting to generate audio beyond their quota within a short billing window will now receive a clearer `401 unauthorized: This request exceeds your quota limit of...` error message indicating the limit has been exceeded.

## SDKs

- **Released new SDKs**: Added [ElevenLabs Python v1.58.0](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-python) and [ElevenLabs JS v1.58.0](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js) to fix a breaking change that had been mistakenly shipped
