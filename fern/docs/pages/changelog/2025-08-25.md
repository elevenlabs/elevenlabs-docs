- **Enhanced agent configuration**: Improved agent creation and management with additional workspace override capabilities and refined platform settings.

### Text to Speech

- **Pronunciation dictionary updates**: Added support for updating pronunciation dictionaries with PATCH operations, enabling more flexible dictionary management.
- **Enhanced timestamp support**: Improved timestamp generation for text-to-speech conversions with better alignment data and streaming capabilities.
