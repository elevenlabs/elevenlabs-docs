### Studio

- **Disable publishing UI**: Added ability to disable the publishing interface for specific workspace members to support enterprise workflows.
- **Snapshot API improvement**: Modified endpoints for project and chapter snapshots to return an empty list instead of throwing errors when snapshots can't be downloaded.
- **Disabled auto-moderation**: Turned off automatic moderation based on Text to Speech generations in Studio.

### Workspaces
