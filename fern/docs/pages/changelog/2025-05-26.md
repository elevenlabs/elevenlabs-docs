### Forced Aligment

- **Forced alignment improvements**: Fixed a rare failure case in forced alignment processing to improve reliability.

### Voices

- **Live moderated voices filter**: Added `include_live_moderated` query parameter to the shared voices endpoint, allowing you to include or exclude voices that are live moderated.

### Conversational AI

- **Secret dynamic variables**: Added support for specifying dynamic variables as secrets with the `secret__` prefix. Secret dynamic variables can only be used in webhook tool headers and are never sent to an LLM, enhancing security for sensitive data. [Learn more](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/personalization/dynamic-variables#secret-dynamic-variables).
- **Skip turn system tool**: Introduced a new system tool called **skip_turn**. When enabled, the agent will skip its turn if the user explicitly indicates they need a moment to think or perform an action (e.g., "just a sec", "give me a minute"). This prevents turn timeout from being triggered during intentional user pauses. See the [skip turn tool docs](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools/system-tools/skip-turn) for more information.
- **Text input support**: Added text input support in websocket connections via "user_message" event with text field. Also added "user_activity" event support to indicate typing or other UI activity, improving agent turn-taking when there's interleaved text and audio input.
- **RAG chunk limit**: Added ability to configure the [maximum number of chunks](/docs/api-reference/agents/create#request.body.conversation_config.agent.prompt.rag.max_retrieved_rag_chunks_count) collected during RAG retrieval, giving users
  more control over context window usage and costs.
- **Enhanced widget configuration**: Expanded widget customization options to include [text input and text only mode](/docs/api-reference/widget/get#response.body.widget_config.text_only).
- **LLM usage calculator**: Introduced tools to calculate expected LLM token usage and costs for agents, helping with cost estimation and planning.

### Audio Native

- **Accessibility improvements**: Enhanced accessibility for the AudioNative player with multiple improvements:
  - Added aria-labels for all buttons
  - Enabled keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
  - Made progress bar handle focusable and keyboard-accessible
  - Improved focus indicator visibility for better screen reader compatibility
