### Text to Speech

- **Forced alignment improvements**: Fixed a rare failure case in forced alignment processing to improve reliability.

### Conversational AI

- **Secret dynamic variables**: Added support for specifying dynamic variables as secrets with the "secret\_\_" prefix. Secret dynamic variables can only be used in webhook tool headers and are never sent to the LLM, enhancing security for sensitive data.
- **Skip turn system tool**: Introduced a new system tool called **skip_turn**. When enabled, the agent will skip its turn if the user explicitly indicates they need a moment to think or perform an action (e.g., "just a sec", "give me a minute"). This prevents turn timeout from being triggered during intentional user pauses.
- **Text input support**: Added text input support in websocket connections via "user_message" event with text field. Also added "user_activity" event support to indicate typing or other UI activity, improving agent turn-taking when there's interleaved text and audio input.
- **RAG chunk limit**: Added ability to configure the maximum number of chunks collected during RAG retrieval, giving users more control over context window usage and costs.

  - Added aria-labels for all buttons
  - Enabled keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
  - Made progress bar handle focusable and keyboard-accessible
