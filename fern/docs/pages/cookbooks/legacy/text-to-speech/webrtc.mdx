## Introduction

WebRTC is a technology that enables real-time communication between web browsers and servers. It allows for low-latency, high-quality audio and video communication, and is supported by most modern browsers.

In this guide, we'll build a simple WebRTC application entirely in Python.
Our application will continuously listen for incoming audio from a microphone and then repeat the audio back to the user in a different voice.
We'll use the `fastrtc` library to handle the WebRTC connection and the `elevenlabs` library to handle the speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion.

This is a preview of what we'll build:

## Setup

Install the required packages to manage environmental variables and handle the WebRTC connection:


```bash
pip install python-dotenv
pip install fastrtc[vad]
pip install elevenlabs
```

Next, create a `.env` file in your project directory and add your API key:

```bash .env
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
```

Create a new file named `webrtc-streaming.py` for our code.
## Initialize the client

First, let's initialize the ElevenLabs client with the API key from the `.env` file:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from elevenlabs import ElevenLabs

load_dotenv()

elevenlabs_client = ElevenLabs(api_key=os.getenv("ELEVENLABS_API_KEY"))
```

## Define the Echo function

The `echo` function will take as input the user's audio and the desired voice ID.
It will then convert the incoming audio to text and then to speech with the ElevenLabs client.

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.typing import NDArray

def echo(audio: tuple[int, NDArray[np.int16]], voice_id: str):
    transcription = elevenlabs_client.speech_to_text.convert(
        file=audio_to_bytes(audio),
        model_id="scribe_v1",
        tag_audio_events=True,
        language_code="eng",
    )
    for chunk in elevenlabs_client.text_to_speech.convert_as_stream(
        text=transcription.text,  # type: ignore
        voice_id=voice_id,
        model_id="eleven_multilingual_v2",
        output_format="pcm_24000",
    ):
        audio_array = np.frombuffer(chunk, dtype=np.int16).reshape(1, -1)
        yield (24000, audio_array)
```

## Define the FastRTC Application

Now we'll create a FastRTC `Stream` object to turn our echo function into a WebRTC stream. We'll wrap the `echo` function with `ReplyOnPause` to handle turn-taking and voice activity detection. We'll also add a dropdown to let users select different voices:

```python
import gradio as gr
from fastrtc import ReplyOnPause, Stream

stream = Stream(
    ReplyOnPause(echo),
    modality="audio",
    mode="send-receive",
    additional_inputs=[
        gr.Dropdown(
            choices=[
                ("Alice", "Xb7hH8MSUJpSbSDYk0k2"),
                ("Aria", "9BWtsMINqrJLrRacOk9x"),
                ("Bill", "pqHfZKP75CvOlQylNhV4"),
                ("Brian", "nPczCjzI2devNBz1zQrb"),
            ]
        )
    ],
    ui_args={
        "title": "Echo Audio with ElevenLabs",
        "subtitle": "Choose a voice and speak naturally. The model will echo it back in a different voice.",
    },
)

stream.ui.launch()
```

## Run the application

```bash
python webrtc-streaming.py
```

## Conclusion

You've now implemented a WebRTC streaming application in just 50 lines of Python! This example demonstrates how to create a real-time audio processing pipeline that leverages ElevenLabs' speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities.
