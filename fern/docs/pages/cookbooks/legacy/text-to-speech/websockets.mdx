subtitle: Learn how to convert text to speech via a WebSocket connection.
---

Websocket streaming is a method of sending and receiving data over a single, long-lived connection. This method is useful for real-time applications where you need to stream audio data as it becomes available.

If you want to quickly test out the latency (time to first byte) of a websocket connection to the ElevenLabs text-to-speech API, you can install `elevenlabs-latency` via `npm` and follow the instructions [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elevenlabs-latency?activeTab=readme).

## Requirements

- An ElevenLabs account with an API key (here’s how to [find your API key](/docs/api-reference/authentication)).
- Python or Node.js/Typescript installed on your machine

## Setup

Install dotenv package to manage your environmental variables:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Python
pip install python-dotenv
pip install websockets
```

```bash TypeScript
npm install dotenv
npm install @types/dotenv --save-dev
npm install ws
```

</CodeGroup>

Next, create a `.env` file in your project directory and fill it with your credentials like so:

```bash .env
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
```

Last, create a new file to write the code in. You can name it `text-to-speech-websocket.py` for Python or `text-to-speech-websocket.ts` for Typescript.

## Initiate the websocket connection

Pick a voice from the voice library and a text-to-speech model; Then initiate a websocket connection to the text-to-speech API.

<CodeGroup>

```python text-to-speech-websocket.py (Python)
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import websockets

# Load the API key from the .env file
load_dotenv()
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = os.getenv("ELEVENLABS_API_KEY")

voice_id = 'kmSVBPu7loj4ayNinwWM'
model_id = 'eleven_flash_v2_5'

async def text_to_speech_ws_streaming(voice_id, model_id):
    uri = f"wss://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}/stream-input?model_id={model_id}"

    async with websockets.connect(uri) as websocket:
       ...
```

```typescript text-to-speech-websocket.ts (Typescript)
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
// @ts-ignore
import WebSocket from 'ws';

// Load the API key from the .env file
dotenv.config();
const ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = process.env.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY;

const voiceId = 'Xb7hH8MSUJpSbSDYk0k2';
const model = 'eleven_flash_v2_5';
const uri = `wss://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/${voiceId}/stream-input?model_id=${model}`;
const websocket = new WebSocket(uri, {
  headers: { 'xi-api-key': `${ELEVENLABS_API_KEY}` },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

For TypeScript, create a write stream ahead for saving the audio into mp3 which can be passed to the websocket listener.

```typescript text-to-speech-websocket.ts (Typescript)
import * as fs from 'node:fs';

const outputDir = './output';
try {
  fs.accessSync(outputDir, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK);
} catch (err) {
  fs.mkdirSync(outputDir);
}
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream(outputDir + '/test.mp3', {
  flags: 'a',
});
```

## Send the input text

Once the websocket connection is open, set up voice settings first. Next, send the text message to the API.

<CodeGroup>

```python text-to-speech-websocket.py (Python)
async def text_to_speech_ws_streaming(voice_id, model_id):
    async with websockets.connect(uri) as websocket:
        await websocket.send(json.dumps({
            "text": " ",
            "voice_settings": {"stability": 0.5, "similarity_boost": 0.8, "use_speaker_boost": False},
            "generation_config": {
                "chunk_length_schedule": [120, 160, 250, 290]
            },
            "xi_api_key": ELEVENLABS_API_KEY,
        }))

        text = "The twilight sun cast its warm golden hues upon the vast rolling fields, saturating the landscape with an ethereal glow. Silently, the meandering brook continued its ceaseless journey, whispering secrets only the trees seemed privy to."
        await websocket.send(json.dumps({"text": text}))

        // Send empty string to indicate the end of the text sequence which will close the websocket connection
        await websocket.send(json.dumps({"text": ""}))
```

```typescript text-to-speech-websocket.ts (Typescript)
const text =
  'The twilight sun cast its warm golden hues upon the vast rolling fields, saturating the landscape with an ethereal glow. ';

websocket.on('open', async () => {
  websocket.send(
    JSON.stringify({
      text: ' ',
      voice_settings: {
        stability: 0.5,
        similarity_boost: 0.8,
        use_speaker_boost: false,
      },
      generation_config: { chunk_length_schedule: [120, 160, 250, 290] },
    })
  );

  websocket.send(JSON.stringify({ text: text }));

  // Send empty string to indicate the end of the text sequence which will close the websocket connection
  websocket.send(JSON.stringify({ text: '' }));
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Save the audio to file

Read the incoming message from the websocket connection and write the audio chunks to a local file.

<CodeGroup>

```python text-to-speech-websocket.py (Python)
import asyncio

async def write_to_local(audio_stream):
    """Write the audio encoded in base64 string to a local mp3 file."""

    with open(f'./output/test.mp3', "wb") as f:
        async for chunk in audio_stream:
            if chunk:
                f.write(chunk)

async def listen(websocket):
    """Listen to the websocket for audio data and stream it."""

    while True:
        try:
            message = await websocket.recv()
            data = json.loads(message)
            if data.get("audio"):
                yield base64.b64decode(data["audio"])
            elif data.get('isFinal'):
                break

        except websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed:
            print("Connection closed")
            break

async def text_to_speech_ws_streaming(voice_id, model_id):
    async with websockets.connect(uri) as websocket:
          ...
          # Add listen task to submit the audio chunks to the write_to_local function
          listen_task = asyncio.create_task(write_to_local(listen(websocket)))

          await listen_task

asyncio.run(text_to_speech_ws_streaming(voice_id, model_id))
```

```typescript text-to-speech-websocket.ts (Typescript)
// Helper function to write the audio encoded in base64 string into local file
function writeToLocal(base64str: any, writeStream: fs.WriteStream) {
  const audioBuffer: Buffer = Buffer.from(base64str, 'base64');
  writeStream.write(audioBuffer, (err) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error writing to file:', err);
    }
  });
}

// Listen to the incoming message from the websocket connection
websocket.on('message', function incoming(event) {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.toString());
  if (data['audio']) {
    writeToLocal(data['audio'], writeStream);
  }
});

// Close the writeStream when the websocket connection closes
websocket.on('close', () => {
  writeStream.end();
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Run the script

You can run the script by executing the following command in your terminal. An mp3 audio file will be saved in the `output` directory.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python python text-to-speech-websocket.py ``` ```typescript Typescript tsx
  text-to-speech-websocket.ts ```
</CodeGroup>

## Understanding buffering

A key concept to understand when using websockets is buffering. The API only runs model generations when a certain amount of text above a threshold has been sent. This is to optimize the quality of the generated audio by maximising the amount of context available to the model while balancing latency.

For example, if the threshold is set to 120 characters and you send 'Hello, how are you?', the audio won't be generated immediately. This is because the sent message has only 19 characters which is below the threshold. However, if you keep sending text, the API will generate audio once the total text sent since the last generation has at least 120 characters.

In the case that you want force the immediate return of the audio, you can use `flush=true` to clear out the buffer and force generate any buffered text. This can be useful, for example, when you have reached the end of a document and want to generate audio for the final section.

In addition, closing the websocket will automatically force generate any buffered text.

## Best practice

- We suggest using the default setting for `chunk_length_schedule` in `generation_config`. Avoid using `try_trigger_generation` as it is deprecated.
- When developing a real-time conversational AI application, we advise using `flush=true` along with the text at the end of conversation turn to ensure timely audio generation.
- If the default setting doesn't provide optimal latency for your use case, you can modify the `chunk_length_schedule`. However, be mindful that reducing latency through this adjustment may come at the expense of quality.

## Tips

- The API maintains a internal buffer so that it only runs model generations when a certain amount of text above a threshold has been sent. For short texts with a character length smaller than the value set in `chunk_length_schedule`, you can use `flush=true` to clear out the buffer and force generate any buffered text.
- The websocket connection will automatically close after 20 seconds of inactivity. To keep the connection open, you can send a single space character `" "`. Please note that this string must include a space, as sending a fully empty string, `""`, will close the websocket.
- Send an empty string to close the websocket connection after sending the last text message.
- You can use `alignment` to get the word-level timestamps for each word in the text. This can be useful for aligning the audio with the text in a video or for other applications that require precise timing.
