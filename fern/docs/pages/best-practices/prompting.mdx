<Info>
  We are actively working on _Director's Mode_ to give you even greater control over outputs.
</Info>

This guide provides techniques to enhance text-to-speech outputs using ElevenLabs models. Experiment with these methods to discover what works best for your needs. These techniques provide a practical way to achieve nuanced results until advanced features like _Director's Mode_ are rolled out.

## Pauses

Use `<break time="x.xs" />` for natural pauses up to 3 seconds.

<Note>
  Using too many break tags in a single generation can cause instability. The AI might speed up, or
  introduce additional noises or audio artifacts. We are working on resolving this.
</Note>

```text Example
"Hold on, let me think." <break time="1.5s" /> "Alright, I’ve got it."
```

- **Consistency:** Use `<break>` tags consistently to maintain natural speech flow. Excessive use can lead to instability.
- **Voice-Specific Behavior:** Different voices may handle pauses differently, especially those trained with filler sounds like "uh" or "ah."

Alternatives to `<break>` include dashes (- or --) for short pauses or ellipses (...) for hesitant tones. However, these are less consistent.

```text Example

"It… well, it might work." "Wait — what’s that noise?"

```

## Pronunciation

### Phoneme Tags

Specify pronunciation using [SSML phoneme tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_Synthesis_Markup_Language). Supported alphabets include [CMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMU_Pronouncing_Dictionary) Arpabet and the [International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet).

<Note>
  Phoneme tags are only compatible with "Eleven English v1" and "Eleven Turbo v2"
  [models](/docs/models).
</Note>

<CodeBlock>
```xml CMU Arpabet Example
<phoneme alphabet="cmu-arpabet" ph="M AE1 D IH0 S AH0 N">
  Madison
</phoneme>
```

```xml IPA Example
<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈæktʃuəli">
  actually
</phoneme>
```

</CodeBlock>

We recommend using CMU Arpabet for consistent and predictable results with current AI models. While IPA can be effective, CMU Arpabet generally offers more reliable performance.

Phoneme tags only work for individual words. If for example you have a name with a first and last name that you want to be pronounced a certain way, you will need to create a phoneme tag for each word.

Ensure correct stress marking for multi-syllable words to maintain accurate pronunciation. For example:

<CodeBlock>

```xml Correct usage
<phoneme alphabet="cmu-arpabet" ph="P R AH0 N AH0 N S IY EY1 SH AH0 N">
  pronunciation
</phoneme>
```

```xml Incorrect usage
<phoneme alphabet="cmu-arpabet" ph="P R AH N AH N S IY EY SH AH N">
  pronunciation
</phoneme>
```

</CodeBlock>

### Alias Tags

For models that don't support phoneme tags, you can try writing words more phonetically. You can also employ various tricks such as capital letters, dashes, apostrophes, or even single quotation marks around a single letter or letters.

As an example, a word like “trapezii” could be spelt “trapezIi” to put more emphasis on the “ii” of the word.

You can either replace the word directly in your text, or if you want to specify pronunciation using other words or phrases when using a pronunciation dictionary, you can use alias tags for this. This can be useful if you're generating using Multilingual v2 or Turbo v2.5, which don't support phoneme tags. You can use pronunciation dictionaries with Studio, Dubbing Studio and Speech Synthesis via the API.

For example, if your text includes a name that has an unusual pronunciation that the AI might struggle with, you could use an alias tag to specify how you would like it to be pronounced:

```
  <lexeme>
    <grapheme>Claughton</grapheme>
    <alias>Cloffton</alias>
  </lexeme>
```

If you want to make sure that an acronym is always delivered in a certain way whenever it is incountered in your text, you can use an alias tag to specify this:

```
  <lexeme>
    <grapheme>UN</grapheme>
    <alias>United Nations</alias>
  </lexeme>
```

### Pronunciation Dictionaries

Some of our tools, such as Studio and Dubbing Studio, allow you to create and upload a pronunciation dictionary. These allow you to specify the pronunciation of certain words, such as character or brand names, or to specify how acronyms should be read.

Pronunciation dictionaries allow this functionality by enabling you to upload a lexicon or dictionary file that specifies pairs of words and how they should be pronounced, either using a phonetic alphabet or word substitutions.

Whenever one of these words is encountered in a project, the AI model will pronounce the word using the specified replacement.

To provide a pronunciation dictionary file, open the settings for a project and upload a file in either TXT or the [.PLS format](https://www.w3.org/TR/pronunciation-lexicon/). When a dictionary is added to a project it will automatically recalculate which pieces of the project will need to be re-converted using the new dictionary file and mark these as unconverted.

Currently we only support pronunciation dictionaries that specify replacements using phoneme or alias tags.

Both phonemes and aliases are sets of rules that specify a word or phrase they are looking for, referred to as a grapheme, and what it will be replaced with. Please note that searches are case sensitive. When checking for a replacement word in a pronunciation dictionary, the dictionary is checked from start to end and only the very first replacement is used.

### Pronunciation Dictionary Example

Here is an example pronunciation dictionary that specifies in IPA the pronunciation of "Apple" with IPA of "ˈæpl̩" and "UN" with an alias of "United Nations":

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<lexicon version="1.0"
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/01/pronunciation-lexicon"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.w3.org/2005/01/pronunciation-lexicon
        http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/CR-pronunciation-lexicon-20071212/pls.xsd"
      alphabet="ipa" xml:lang="en-GB">
  <lexeme>
    <grapheme>Apple</grapheme>
    <phoneme>ˈæpl̩</phoneme>
  </lexeme>
  <lexeme>
    <grapheme>UN</grapheme>
    <alias>United Nations</alias>
  </lexeme>
</lexicon>
```

To generate a pronunciation dictionary `.pls` file, there are a few open source tools available:

    - [Sequitur G2P](https://github.com/sequitur-g2p/sequitur-g2p) - Open-source tool that learns pronunciation rules from data and can generate phonetic transcriptions.
    - [Phonetisaurus](https://github.com/AdolfVonKleist/Phonetisaurus) - Open-source G2P system trained on existing dictionaries like CMUdict.
    - [eSpeak](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng) - Speech synthesizer that can generate phoneme transcriptions from text.
    - [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](https://github.com/cmusphinx/cmudict) - A pre-built English dictionary with phonetic transcriptions.

## Emotion

Convey emotions through narrative context or explicit dialogue tags. This approach helps the AI understand the tone and emotion to emulate.

```text Example
You’re leaving?" she asked, her voice trembling with sadness. "That’s it!" he exclaimed triumphantly.
```

Explicit dialogue tags yield more predictable results than relying solely on context, however the model will still speak out the emotional delivery guides. These can be removed in post-production using an audio editor if unwanted.

## Pace

Pacing can be controlled by writing in a natural, narrative style. For voice cloning, longer, continuous samples are recommended to avoid pacing issues like unnaturally fast speech.

```text Example
"I… I thought you’d understand," he said, his voice slowing with disappointment.
```

Sample Length: Use longer, continuous samples for voice cloning to avoid pacing issues.

Narrative Style: Write in a narrative style to naturally control pacing and emotion, similar to scriptwriting.

## Creative control

While we are actively developing a "Director's Mode" to give users even greater control over outputs, here are some interim techniques to maximize creativity and precision:

<Steps>
    ### Narrative styling
    Write prompts in a narrative style, similar to scriptwriting, to guide tone and pacing effectively.

    ### Layered outputs

    Generate sound effects or speech in segments and layer them together using audio editing software for more complex compositions.

    ### Phonetic experimentation

    If pronunciation isn't perfect, experiment with alternate spellings or phonetic approximations to achieve desired results.

    ### Manual adjustments

    Combine individual sound effects manually in post-production for sequences that require precise timing.

    ### Feedback iteration

    Iterate on results by tweaking descriptions, tags, or emotional cues.

</Steps>
