## General

Subtitles and captions ordered from Productions are reviewed and edited by native speakers for maximum accuracy and accessibility. We offer different types of subtitles and captions to meet your specific needs.

- For more detailed pricing information, please see the [**Pricing**](#pricing) section below.
- For more information about other Productions services, please see the [Overview](/docs/services/productions/overview) page.

## Captions vs. subtitles

Captions and subtitles serve different audiences and purposes, although they both display text on screen.

- **Captions** are designed for deaf or hard-of-hearing viewers. They transcribe all spoken dialogue and include descriptions of relevant non-speech sounds (e.g., [door slams], [dramatic music]). They are typically not translated from the original language.

- **Subtitles** are for hearing viewers who do not understand the language of the audio. They focus exclusively on translating spoken dialogue and do not usually include sound effects or speaker identification.
