subtitle: Human-edited captions and subtitles from ElevenLabs Productions
---

## General

Subtitles and captions ordered from Productions are reviewed and edited by native speakers for maximum accuracy and accessibility. We offer both subtitles and captions to meet your specific needs.

- For more detailed pricing information, please see the [**Pricing**](#pricing) section below.
- For more information about other Productions services, please see the [Overview](/docs/services/productions/overview) page.

## Captions vs. subtitles

Captions and subtitles serve different audiences and purposes, although they both display text on screen.

- **Captions** transcribe spoken dialogue and include SDH<a href="#sdh-footnote" aria-label="SDH footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> by default. They are not translated.

- **Subtitles** translate spoken dialogue for viewers who do not understand the source language; SDH<a href="#sdh-footnote" aria-label="SDH footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> can by included upon request.
