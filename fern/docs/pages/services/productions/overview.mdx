## How it works

<Steps>
    <Step title="Upload new files or select existing files">
        **Ordering a new asset**: head to the [Productions](https://elevenlabs.io/app/productions) page of your ElevenLabs account and create a new order. You may also see a _Productions_ option when using the order dialog for other products like [Speech to Text](https://elevenlabs.io/app/speech-to-text) or [Dubbing](https://elevenlabs.io/app/dubbing)

        </Frame>

        **Starting from an existing asset**: you can also order human-edited versions of existing assets in your ElevenLabs account. Look for the 'Get human review' button in the top right of the editor view for this option.
