## General

Transcripts ordered from Productions are reviewed and corrected by native speakers for maximum accuracy.
We offer 2 types of human transcripts:
| **Option** | **When to use it** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Non‑verbatim (”clean”)** | Podcasts, webinars, marketing, personal use | Removes filler words, stutters, audio event tags for smoother reading. Focuses on transcribing the core meaning. Most suitable for the majority of use-cases. |
| **Verbatim** | Legal, research | Attempts to capture _exactly_ what is said, including all filler words, stutters and audio event tags. |

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Non-verbatim">
    Non-verbatim transcription, also called *clean* or *intelligent verbatim*, focuses on clarity and readability. Unlike verbatim transcriptions, it removes unnecessary elements like filler words, stutters, and irrelevant sounds while preserving the speaker’s message.

    <Info>This is the default option for Productions transcriptions. Unless you explicitly select 'Verbatim' mode, we will deliver a non-verbatim transcript.</Info>

    What gets left out in non-verbatim transcripts:
      - **Filler words and verbal tics** like “um,” “like,” “you know,” or “I mean”
      - **Repetitions** including intentional and unintentional (e.g. stuttering)
      - **Audio event tags,** including non-verbal sounds like [coughing] or [throat clearing] as well as environmental sounds like [dog barking]
      - **Slang or incorrect grammar** (e.g. ‘ain’t’ → ‘is not’)

    </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Verbatim">
    In verbatim transcription, the goal is to capture ***everything that can be heard,***, meaning:

      - All detailed verbal elements: stutters, repetitions, etc
      - All non-verbal elements like human sounds ([cough]) and environmental sounds ([dog barking])
