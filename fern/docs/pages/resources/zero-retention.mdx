subtitle: Learn how to use Zero Retention Mode to protect sensitive data.

## Background

By default, we retain data, in accordance with our Privacy Policy, to enhance our services, troubleshoot issues, and ensure the security of our systems. However, for some enterprise customers, we offer a "Zero Retention Mode" option for specific products. In this Zero Retention Mode, most data in requests and responses are immediately deleted once the request is completed.

ElevenLabs has agreements in place with each third-party LLM provider which expressly prohibit such providers from training their models on customer content, whether or not Zero Retention Mode is enabled.

## What is Zero Retention Mode?

Zero Retention Mode provides an additional level of security and peace of mind for especially sensitive workflows. When enabled, logging of certain data points is restricted, including:

- TTS text input
- TTS audio output
- Voice Changer audio input
- Voice Changer audio output
- STT audio input
- STT text output
- Conversational AI all input and output
- Email associated with the account generating the input in our logs

This data is related to the processing of the request, and can only be seen by the user doing the request and the volatile memory of the process serving the request. None of this data is sent at any point to a database where data is stored long term.

## Who has access to Zero Retention Mode?

Enterprise customers can use Zero Retention Mode. It is primarily intended for use by our customers in the healthcare and banking sector, and other customers who may use our services to process sensitive information.

## When can a customer use Zero Retention Mode?

Zero Retention Mode is available to select enterprise customers. However, access to this feature may be restricted if ElevenLabs determines a customer's use case to be high risk, if an account is flagged by an automated system for additional moderation or at ElevenLabs' sole discretion. In such cases, the enterprise administrator will be promptly notified of the restriction.

## How does Zero Retention Mode work?

Zero Retention Mode only works for API requests, specifically:

- **Text to Speech**: this covers the Text-to-Speech (TTS) API, including all endpoints beginning with `/v1/text-to-speech/` and the TTS websocket connection.
- **Voice Changer**: this covers the Voice Changer API, including all endpoints starting with `/v1/speech-to-speech/`.

After setup, check the request history to verify Zero Retention Mode is enabled. If enabled, there should be no requests in the history.

Zero Retention Mode can be used by sending `enable_logging=false` with the product which supports it.

For example, in the Text to Speech API, you can set the query parameter [enable_logging](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech#parameter-enable-logging) to a `false` value:

<CodeBlocks>

```python title="Python" {12}
from elevenlabs import ElevenLabs

elevenlabs = ElevenLabs(
  api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
)

response = elevenlabs.text_to_speech.convert(
  voice_id=voice_id,
  output_format="mp3_22050_32",
  text=text,
  model_id="eleven_turbo_v2",
  enable_logging=False,
)

```

```javascript title="JavaScript" {9}
import { ElevenLabsClient } from '@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js';

const elevenlabs = new ElevenLabsClient({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });

await elevenlabs.textToSpeech.convert(voiceId, {
  outputFormat: 'mp3_44100_128',
  text: text,
  modelId: 'eleven_turbo_v2',
  enableLogging: false,
});
```

```bash title="cURL"
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}?enable_logging=false' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are some limitations of Zero Retention Mode?" default>
    Troubleshooting and support for Zero Retention Mode is limited. Because of the configuration, we
    will not be able to diagnose issues with TTS/STS generations. Debugging will be more difficult
    as a result.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does retention work if Zero Retention Mode is not active?">
    Customers by default have history preservation enabled. All customers can use the API to delete
    generations at any time. This action will immediately remove the corresponding audio and text
    from our database; however, debugging and moderation logs may still retain data related to the
    generation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Data backup (When Zero Retention Mode is not used)">
    For any retained data, we regularly back up such data to prevent data loss in the event of any
    unexpected incidents. Following data deletion, database items are retained in backups for up to
    30 days After this period, the data expires and is not recoverable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Account deletion (When Zero Retention Mode is not used)">
    All data is deleted from our systems permanently when you delete your account. This includes all
    data associated with your account, such as API keys, request history, and any other data stored
    in your account. We also take commercially reasonable efforts to delete debugging data related
    to your account.
