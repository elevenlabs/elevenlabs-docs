subtitle: Protocol for optimized AI agent to agent communication.
---

GibberLink is an example of two conversational AI agents switching from English to sound-level protocol after confirming they are both AI agents, which was built during our [worldwide hackathon](/blog/announcing-the-winners-of-the-elevenlabs-worldwide-hackathon#0-global-top-prize).

The project is open source and can be inspected on modiefied [on GitHub](https://github.com/PennyroyalTea/gibberlink).

based on [ggwave](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggwave) library by [Georgi Gerganov](https://github.com/ggerganov) and conversational AI by [ElevenLabs](https://try.elevenlabs.io/gibberlink)

## How it works

- Two independent conversational [ElevenLabs](https://try.elevenlabs.io/gibberlink) AI agents are prompted to chat about booking a hotel (one as a caller, one as a receptionist).
- Both agents are prompted to switch to [ggwave](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggwave) data-over-sound protocol when they identify other side as AI, and keep speaking in english otherwise.
- This repository provides APIs that allows agents to use the protocol.
