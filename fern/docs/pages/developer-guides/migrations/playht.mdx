ElevenLabs provides a seamless migration path for PlayHT users. This guide will walk you through the steps to migrate your PlayHT voice generation and Text To Speech workflows to ElevenLabs.

The ElevenLabs API provides a simple interface to state-of-the-art audio [models](/docs/models) and [features](/docs/api-reference/introduction). Follow this guide to learn how to create lifelike speech with our Text to Speech API. See the [developer guides](/docs/quickstart#explore-our-developer-guides) for more examples with our other products.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Install the SDK">
      <Markdown src="/snippets/quickstart-install-sdk.mdx" />

      <Note>
        To play the audio through your speakers, you may be prompted to install [MPV](https://mpv.io/)
      and/or [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).
      </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Make your first request">
      Create a new file named `example.py` or `example.mts`, depending on your language of choice and add the following code:
       <Markdown src="/snippets/generated/quickstart_tts.mdx" />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the code">
        <CodeBlocks>
            ```python
            python example.py
            ```

            ```typescript
            npx tsx example.mts
            ```
        </CodeBlocks>

        You should hear the audio play through your speakers.
    </Step>
