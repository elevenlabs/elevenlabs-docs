    </Step>
    <Step title="Install the SDK">
      <Markdown src="/snippets/quickstart-install-sdk.mdx" />

      <Note>
        To play the audio through your speakers, you may be prompted to install [MPV](https://mpv.io/)
      and/or [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).
      </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Make your first request">
      Create a new file named `example.py` or `example.mts`, depending on your language of choice and add the following code:
       <Markdown src="/snippets/generated/quickstart_tts.mdx" />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the code">
        <CodeBlocks>
            ```python
            python example.py
            ```

            ```typescript
            npx tsx example.mts
            ```
        </CodeBlocks>

        You should hear the audio play through your speakers.
    </Step>
