title: Streaming speech to text
subtitle: Learn how to transcribe audio with ElevenLabs
---

<Note>This feature is currently only available to alpha users and is subject to change.</Note>

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to transcribe audio with the ElevenLabs SDK and stream the response back.

The difference between this and the [synchronous](/docs/cookbooks/speech-to-text/quickstart) example is that the streaming example returns the result as a stream of data. As such the latency between the transcription and the result is lower as it's streamed back in chunks rather than waiting for the entire response.

## Requirements

- An ElevenLabs account with an [API key](/docs/developer-guides/quickstart#authentication).
- Python or Node installed on your machine

## Setup

### Installing the SDK

Before you begin, make sure you have installed the ElevenLabs SDK.

<CodeGroup>
    ```bash Python
    pip install elevenlabs
    ```

    ```bash JavaScript
    npm install @elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js
    ```

</CodeGroup>

Additionally, install necessary packages to manage your environmental variables:

<CodeGroup>
    ```bash Python
    pip install python-dotenv
    ```

    ```bash JavaScript
    npm install dotenv
    ```

</CodeGroup>

Next, create a `.env` file in your project directory and fill it with your credentials like so:

```python .env
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
```

To convert the audio of a file to text, we'll use the `convert` method of the ElevenLabs SDK.

## Convert text to speech with streaming response

If you prefer to stream the text directly without saving it to a file, you can use our streaming feature.

<CodeGroup>

```python title="speech_to_text_stream.py" maxLines=0
import os
from typing import IO
from io import BytesIO
from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs
import requests

from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

elevenlabs = ElevenLabs(
    api_key=os.getenv("ELEVENLABS_API_KEY"),
)

audio_url = (
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/eleven-public-cdn/audio/marketing/nicole.mp3"
)
response = requests.get(audio_url)
audio_data = BytesIO(response.content)

# Perform the text-to-speech conversion
transcription = elevenlabs.speech_to_text.stream(
    model_id="scribe_v1",
    file=audio_data
)

for chunk in transcription:
    # If you want to extract just the text:
    print(chunk.text)

```

```javascript title="speechToTextStream.js" maxLines=0
import { ElevenLabsClient } from '@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js';
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

const elevenlabs = new ElevenLabsClient();

const response = await fetch(
  'https://storage.googleapis.com/eleven-public-cdn/audio/marketing/nicole.mp3'
);
const audioBlob = new Blob([await response.arrayBuffer()], { type: 'audio/mp3' });

const transcription = await elevenlabs.speechToText.stream({
  file: audioBlob,
  modelId: 'scribe_v1',
  maximumSpeakers: 1, // Number of speakers in the audio file
  tagAudioEvents: true, // Tag audio events like laughter, applause, etc.
  speechToTextLanguageCode: 'en', // Language of the audio file
  transcribeVerbatim: false, // Transcribe verbatim sounds like "um" and "ah"
});

for await (const chunk of transcription) {
  console.log(chunk.text);
}
```

</CodeGroup>

You can then run this function with:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Python
python speech_to_text_stream.py
```

```bash TypeScript
node speechToTextStream.js
```

</CodeGroup>
