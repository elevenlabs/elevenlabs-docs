## Using the Eleven Music API

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create an API key">
        <Markdown src="/snippets/quickstart-api-key.mdx" />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install the SDK">
        <Markdown src="/snippets/quickstart-install-sdk.mdx" />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Make the API request">
        Create a new file named `example.py` or `example.mts`, depending on your language of choice and add the following code:

        <CodeBlocks>
        ```python
        # example.py
        from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs
        from elevenlabs import play
        import os
        from io import BytesIO
        from dotenv import load_dotenv
        load_dotenv()

        elevenlabs = ElevenLabs(
            api_key=os.getenv("ELEVENLABS_API_KEY"),
        )

        stream = elevenlabs.music.stream(
            prompt="Create an intense, fast-paced electronic track for a high-adrenaline video game scene. Use driving synth arpeggios, punchy drums, distorted bass, glitch effects, and aggressive rhythmic textures. The tempo should be fast, 130–150 bpm, with rising tension, quick transitions, and dynamic energy bursts.",
            music_length_ms=10000,
        )

        # Create a BytesIO object to hold the audio data in memory
        audio_stream = BytesIO()

        # Write each chunk of audio data to the stream
        for chunk in stream:
            if chunk:
                audio_stream.write(chunk)

        # Reset stream position to the beginning
        audio_stream.seek(0)

        play(audio_stream)
        ```

        ```typescript
        // example.mts
        import { ElevenLabsClient, play } from "@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js";
        import "dotenv/config";

        const elevenlabs = new ElevenLabsClient();

        const stream = await elevenlabs.music.stream({
          prompt: "Create an intense, fast-paced electronic track for a high-adrenaline video game scene. Use driving synth arpeggios, punchy drums, distorted bass, glitch effects, and aggressive rhythmic textures. The tempo should be fast, 130–150 bpm, with rising tension, quick transitions, and dynamic energy bursts.",
          musicLengthMs: 10000,
        });

        const chunks: Buffer[] = [];

        for await (const chunk of stream) {
            chunks.push(chunk);
        }

        const audioStream = Buffer.concat(chunks);

        await play(audioStream);
        ```
        </CodeBlocks>
    </Step>
     <Step title="Execute the code">
        <CodeBlocks>
            ```python
            python example.py
            ```

            ```typescript
            npx tsx example.mts
            ```
        </CodeBlocks>

        You should hear the generated music playing.
    </Step>
