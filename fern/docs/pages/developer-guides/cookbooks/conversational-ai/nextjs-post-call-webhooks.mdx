</Tip>

## Requirements

- An ElevenLabs account with an [API key](/app/settings/api-keys).
- Node.js v18 or higher installed on your machine.

## Setup

### Create a new Next.js project

We recommend using our [v0.dev Conversational AI template](https://v0.dev/community/nextjs-5TN93pl3bRS) as the starting point for your application. This template is a production-ready Next.js application with the Conversational AI agent already integrated.

Alternatively, you can clone the [fully integrated project from GitHub](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-examples/tree/main/examples/conversational-ai/nextjs-post-call-webhook), or create a new blank Next.js project and follow the steps below to integrate the Conversational AI agent.

### Set up conversational AI

Follow our [Next.js guide](/docs/conversational-ai/guides/quickstarts/next-js) for installation and configuration steps. Then come back here to build in the advanced features.

## Agent configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in to ElevenLabs">
    Go to [elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io/sign-up) and sign in to your account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new agent">
    Navigate to [Conversational AI > Agents](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/agents) and
    create a new agent from the blank template.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the first message">
    Set the first message and specify the dynamic variable for the platform.

    ```txt
    Hi {{user_name}}, I'm Jess from the ElevenLabs team. I'm here to help you design your very own conversational AI agent! To kick things off, let me know what kind of agent you're looking to create. For example, do you want a support agent, to help your users answer questions, or a sales agent to sell your products, or just a friend to chat with?
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the system prompt">
    Set the system prompt. You can also include dynamic variables here.

    ```txt
    You are Jess, a helpful agent helping {{user_name}} to design their very own conversational AI agent. The design process involves the following steps:

    "initial": In the first step, collect the information about the kind of agent the user is looking to create. Summarize the user's needs back to them and ask if they are ready to continue to the next step. Only once they confirm proceed to the next step.
    "training": Tell the user to create the agent's knowledge base by uploading documents, or submitting URLs to public websites with information that should be available to the agent. Wait patiently without talking to the user. Only when the user confirms that they've provided everything then proceed to the next step.
    "voice": Tell the user to describe the voice they want their agent to have. For example: "A professional, strong spoken female voice with a slight British accent." Repeat the description of their voice back to them and ask if they are ready to continue to the next step. Only once they confirm proceed to the next step.
    "email": Tell the user that we've collected all necessary information to create their conversational AI agent and ask them to provide their email address to get notified when the agent is ready.

    Always call the `set_ui_state` tool when moving between steps!
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up the client tools">
    Set up the following client tool to navigate between the steps:

    - Name: `set_ui_state`
        - Description: Use this client-side tool to navigate between the different UI states.
        - Wait for response: `true`
        - Response timeout (seconds): 1
        - Parameters:
          - Data type: string
          - Identifier: step
          - Required: true
          - Value Type: LLM Prompt
          - Description: The step to navigate to in the UI. Only use the steps that are defined in the system prompt!

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your agent's voice">
    Navigate to the `Voice` tab and set the voice for your agent. You can find a list of recommended voices for Conversational AI in the [Conversational Voice Design docs](/docs/conversational-ai/best-practices/conversational-voice-design#voices).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the evaluation criteria">
    Navigate to the `Analysis` tab and add a new evaluation criteria.

    - Name: `all_data_provided`
        - Prompt: Evaluate whether the user provided a description of the agent they are looking to generate as well as a description of the voice the agent should have.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the data collection">
    You can use the post call analysis to extract data from the conversation. In the `Analysis` tab, under `Data Collection`, add the following items:

    - Identifier: `voice_description`
        - `data-type`: `String`
        - Description: Based on the description of the voice the user wants the agent to have, generate a concise description of the voice including the age, accent, tone, and character if available.
    - Identifier: `agent_description`
        - `data-type`: `String`
        - Description: Based on the description about the agent the user is looking to design, generate a prompt that can be used to train a model to act as the agent.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the post-call webhook">
    [Post-call webhooks](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/conversational-ai/workflows/post-call-webhooks) are used to notify you when a call ends and the analysis and data extraction steps have been completed.

    In this example the, the post-call webhook does a couple of steps, namely:

    1. Create a custom voice design based on the `voice_description`.
    2. Create a conversational AI agent for the users based on the `agent_description` they provided.
    3. Retrieve the knowledge base documents from the conversation state stored in Redis and attach the knowledge base to the agent.
    4. Send an email to the user to notify them that their custom conversational AI agent is ready to chat.

    When running locally, you will need a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server to the internet.

    ```bash
    ngrok http 3000
    ```

    Navigate to the [Conversational AI settings](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/settings) and under `Post-Call Webhook` create a new webhook and paste in your ngrok URL: `https://<your-url>.ngrok-free.app/api/convai-webhook`.

    After saving the webhook, you will receive a webhooks secret. Make sure to store this secret securely as you will need to set it in your `.env` file later.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Integrate the advanced features

### Set up a Redis database for storing the conversation state

In this example we're using Redis to store the conversation state. This allows us to retrieve the knowledge base documents from the conversation state after the call ends.

If you're deploying to Vercel, you can configure the [Upstash for Redis](https://vercel.com/marketplace/upstash) integration, or alternatively you can sign up for a free [Upstash account](https://upstash.com/) and create a new database.

### Set up Resend for sending post-call emails

In this example we're using Resend to send the post-call email to the user. To do so you will need to create a free [Resend account](https://resend.com/) and set up a new API key.

### Set the environment variables

In the root of your project, create a `.env` file and add the following variables:

```bash
ELEVENLABS_CONVAI_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=
ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=

# Resend
RESEND_API_KEY=
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=

# Upstash Redis
KV_URL=
KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN=
REDIS_URL=
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=
KV_REST_API_URL=
```

### Configure security and authentication

To secure your conversational AI agent, you need to enable authentication in the `Security` tab of the agent configuration.

Once authentication is enabled, you will need to create a signed URL in a secure server-side environment to initiate a conversation with the agent. In Next.js, you can do this by setting up a new API route.

```tsx ./app/api/signed-url/route.ts
import { ElevenLabsClient } from '@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function GET() {
  const agentId = process.env.ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID;
  if (!agentId) {
    throw Error('ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID is not set');
  }
  try {
    const elevenlabs = new ElevenLabsClient();
    const response = await elevenlabs.conversationalAi.conversations.getSignedUrl({
      agentId,
    });
    return NextResponse.json({ signedUrl: response.signedUrl });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Failed to get signed URL' }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

### Start the conversation session

To start the conversation, first, call your API route to get the signed URL, then use the `useConversation` hook to set up the conversation session.

```tsx ./page.tsx {1,4,20-25,31-46}
import { useConversation } from '@elevenlabs/react';

async function getSignedUrl(): Promise<string> {
  const response = await fetch('/api/signed-url');
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw Error('Failed to get signed url');
  }
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.signedUrl;
}

export default function Home() {
  // ...
  const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState<
    'initial' | 'training' | 'voice' | 'email' | 'ready'
  >('initial');
  const [conversationId, setConversationId] = useState('');
  const [userName, setUserName] = useState('');

  const conversation = useConversation({
    onConnect: () => console.log('Connected'),
    onDisconnect: () => console.log('Disconnected'),
    onMessage: (message: string) => console.log('Message:', message),
    onError: (error: Error) => console.error('Error:', error),
  });

  const startConversation = useCallback(async () => {
    try {
      // Request microphone permission
      await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true });
      // Start the conversation with your agent
      const signedUrl = await getSignedUrl();
      const convId = await conversation.startSession({
        signedUrl,
        dynamicVariables: {
          user_name: userName,
        },
        clientTools: {
          set_ui_state: ({ step }: { step: string }): string => {
            // Allow agent to navigate the UI.
            setCurrentStep(step as 'initial' | 'training' | 'voice' | 'email' | 'ready');
            return `Navigated to ${step}`;
          },
        },
      });
      setConversationId(convId);
      console.log('Conversation ID:', convId);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to start conversation:', error);
    }
  }, [conversation, userName]);
  const stopConversation = useCallback(async () => {
    await conversation.endSession();
  }, [conversation]);
  // ...
}
```

### Client tool and dynamic variables

In the agent configuration earlier, you registered the `set_ui_state` client tool to allow the agent to navigate between the different UI states. To put it all together, you need to pass the client tool implementation to the `conversation.startSession` options.

This is also where you can pass in the dynamic variables to the conversation.

```tsx ./page.tsx {3-5,7-11}
const convId = await conversation.startSession({
  signedUrl,
  dynamicVariables: {
    user_name: userName,
  },
  clientTools: {
    set_ui_state: ({ step }: { step: string }): string => {
      // Allow agent to navigate the UI.
      setCurrentStep(step as 'initial' | 'training' | 'voice' | 'email' | 'ready');
      return `Navigated to ${step}`;
    },
  },
});
```

### Uploading documents to the knowledge base

In the `Training` step, the agent will ask the user to upload documents or submit URLs to public websites with information that should be available to their agent. Here you can utilise the new `after` function of [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/after) to allow uploading of documents in the background.

Create a new `upload` server action to handle the knowledge base creation upon form submission. Once all knowledge base documents have been created, store the conversation ID and the knowledge base IDs in the Redis database.

```tsx ./app/actions/upload.ts {26,32,44,56-60}
'use server';

import { ElevenLabsClient } from '@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js';
import { Redis } from '@upstash/redis';
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';
import { after } from 'next/server';

// Initialize Redis
const redis = Redis.fromEnv();

const elevenlabs = new ElevenLabsClient({
  apiKey: process.env.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY,
});

export async function uploadFormData(formData: FormData) {
  const knowledgeBase: Array<{
    id: string;
    type: 'file' | 'url';
    name: string;
  }> = [];
  const files = formData.getAll('file-upload') as File[];
  const email = formData.get('email-input');
  const urls = formData.getAll('url-input');
  const conversationId = formData.get('conversation-id');

  after(async () => {
    // Upload files as background job
    // Create knowledge base entries
    // Loop through files and create knowledge base entries
    for (const file of files) {
      if (file.size > 0) {
        const response = await elevenlabs.conversationalAi.knowledgeBase.documents.createFromFile({
          file,
        });
        if (response.id) {
          knowledgeBase.push({
            id: response.id,
            type: 'file',
            name: file.name,
          });
        }
      }
    }
    // Append all urls
    for (const url of urls) {
      const response = await elevenlabs.conversationalAi.knowledgeBase.documents.createFromUrl({
        url: url as string,
      });
      if (response.id) {
        knowledgeBase.push({
          id: response.id,
          type: 'url',
          name: `url for ${conversationId}`,
        });
      }
    }

    // Store knowledge base IDs and conversation ID in database.
    const redisRes = await redis.set(
      conversationId as string,
      JSON.stringify({ email, knowledgeBase })
    );
    console.log({ redisRes });
  });

  redirect('/success');
}
```

## Handling the post-call webhook

The [post-call webhook](/docs/conversational-ai/workflows/post-call-webhooks) is triggered when a call ends and the analysis and data extraction steps have been completed.

There's a few steps that are happening here, namely:

1. Verify the webhook secret and construct the webhook payload.
2. Create a custom voice design based on the `voice_description`.
3. Create a conversational AI agent for the users based on the `agent_description` they provided.
4. Retrieve the knowledge base documents from the conversation state stored in Redis and attach the knowledge base to the agent.
5. Send an email to the user to notify them that their custom conversational AI agent is ready to chat.

```ts ./app/api/convai-webhook/route.ts
import { ElevenLabsClient } from '@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js';
import { Redis } from '@upstash/redis';
import crypto from 'crypto';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';
import { Resend } from 'resend';

import { EmailTemplate } from '@/components/email/post-call-webhook-email';

// Initialize Redis
const redis = Redis.fromEnv();
// Initialize Resend
const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

const elevenlabs = new ElevenLabsClient({
  apiKey: process.env.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY,
});

export async function GET() {
  return NextResponse.json({ status: 'webhook listening' }, { status: 200 });
}

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const secret = process.env.ELEVENLABS_CONVAI_WEBHOOK_SECRET; // Add this to your env variables
  const { event, error } = await constructWebhookEvent(req, secret);
  if (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: error }, { status: 401 });
  }

  if (event.type === 'post_call_transcription') {
    const { conversation_id, analysis, agent_id } = event.data;

    if (
      agent_id === process.env.ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID &&
      analysis.evaluation_criteria_results.all_data_provided?.result === 'success' &&
      analysis.data_collection_results.voice_description?.value
    ) {
      try {
        // Design the voice
        const voicePreview = await elevenlabs.textToVoice.createPreviews({
          voiceDescription: analysis.data_collection_results.voice_description.value,
          text: 'The night air carried whispers of betrayal, thick as London fog. I adjusted my cufflinks - after all, even spies must maintain appearances, especially when the game is afoot.',
        });
        const voice = await elevenlabs.textToVoice.createVoiceFromPreview({
          voiceName: `voice-${conversation_id}`,
          voiceDescription: `Voice for ${conversation_id}`,
          generatedVoiceId: voicePreview.previews[0].generatedVoiceId,
        });

        // Get the knowledge base from redis
        const redisRes = await getRedisDataWithRetry(conversation_id);
        if (!redisRes) throw new Error('Conversation data not found!');
        // Handle agent creation
        const agent = await elevenlabs.conversationalAi.agents.create({
          name: `Agent for ${conversation_id}`,
          conversationConfig: {
            tts: { voiceId: voice.voice_id },
            agent: {
              prompt: {
                prompt:
                  analysis.data_collection_results.agent_description?.value ??
                  'You are a helpful assistant.',
                knowledgeBase: redisRes.knowledgeBase,
              },
              firstMessage: 'Hello, how can I help you today?',
            },
          },
        });
        console.log('Agent created', { agent: agent.agentId });
        // Send email to user
        console.log('Sending email to', redisRes.email);
        await resend.emails.send({
          from: process.env.RESEND_FROM_EMAIL!,
          to: redisRes.email,
          subject: 'Your Conversational AI agent is ready to chat!',
          react: EmailTemplate({ agentId: agent.agentId }),
        });
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
        return NextResponse.json({ error }, { status: 500 });
      }
    }
  }

  return NextResponse.json({ received: true }, { status: 200 });
}

const constructWebhookEvent = async (req: NextRequest, secret?: string) => {
  const body = await req.text();
  const signatureHeader = req.headers.get('ElevenLabs-Signature');

  return await elevenlabs.webhooks.constructEvent(body, signatureHeader, secret);
};

async function getRedisDataWithRetry(
  conversationId: string,
  maxRetries = 5
): Promise<{
  email: string;
  knowledgeBase: Array<{
    id: string;
    type: 'file' | 'url';
    name: string;
  }>;
} | null> {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      const data = await redis.get(conversationId);
      return data as any;
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === maxRetries) throw error;
      console.log(`Redis get attempt ${attempt} failed, retrying...`);
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    }
  }
  return null;
}
```

Let's go through each step in detail.

### Verify the webhook secret and consrtuct the webhook payload

When the webhook request is received, we first verify the webhook secret and construct the webhook payload.

```ts ./app/api/convai-webhook/route.ts
// ...

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const secret = process.env.ELEVENLABS_CONVAI_WEBHOOK_SECRET;
  const { event, error } = await constructWebhookEvent(req, secret);
  // ...
}

// ...
const constructWebhookEvent = async (req: NextRequest, secret?: string) => {
  const body = await req.text();
  const signatureHeader = req.headers.get('ElevenLabs-Signature');

  return await elevenlabs.webhooks.constructEvent(body, signatureHeader, secret);
};

async function getRedisDataWithRetry(
  conversationId: string,
  maxRetries = 5
): Promise<{
  email: string;
  knowledgeBase: Array<{
    id: string;
    type: 'file' | 'url';
    name: string;
  }>;
} | null> {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      const data = await redis.get(conversationId);
      return data as any;
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === maxRetries) throw error;
      console.log(`Redis get attempt ${attempt} failed, retrying...`);
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    }
  }
  return null;
}
```

### Create a custom voice design based on the `voice_description`

Using the `voice_description` from the webhook payload, we create a custom voice design.

```ts ./app/api/convai-webhook/route.ts {5}
// ...

// Design the voice
const voicePreview = await elevenlabs.textToVoice.createPreviews({
  voiceDescription: analysis.data_collection_results.voice_description.value,
  text: 'The night air carried whispers of betrayal, thick as London fog. I adjusted my cufflinks - after all, even spies must maintain appearances, especially when the game is afoot.',
});
const voice = await elevenlabs.textToVoice.createVoiceFromPreview({
  voiceName: `voice-${conversation_id}`,
  voiceDescription: `Voice for ${conversation_id}`,
  generatedVoiceId: voicePreview.previews[0].generatedVoiceId,
});

// ...
```

### Retrieve the knowledge base documents from the conversation state stored in Redis

The uploading of the documents might take longer than the webhook data analysis, so we'll need to poll the conversation state in Redis until the documents have been uploaded.

```ts ./app/api/convai-webhook/route.ts
// ...

// Get the knowledge base from redis
const redisRes = await getRedisDataWithRetry(conversation_id);
if (!redisRes) throw new Error('Conversation data not found!');
// ...

async function getRedisDataWithRetry(
  conversationId: string,
  maxRetries = 5
): Promise<{
  email: string;
  knowledgeBase: Array<{
    id: string;
    type: 'file' | 'url';
    name: string;
  }>;
} | null> {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      const data = await redis.get(conversationId);
      return data as any;
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === maxRetries) throw error;
      console.log(`Redis get attempt ${attempt} failed, retrying...`);
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    }
  }
  return null;
}
```

### Create a conversational AI agent for the users based on the `agent_description` they provided

Create the conversational AI agent for the user based on the `agent_description` they provided and attach the newly created voice design and knowledge base to the agent.

```ts ./app/api/convai-webhook/route.ts {7,11}
// ...

// Handle agent creation
const agent = await elevenlabs.conversationalAi.agents.create({
  name: `Agent for ${conversationId}`,
  conversationConfig: {
    tts: { voiceId: voice.voiceId },
    agent: {
      prompt: {
        prompt:
          analysis.data_collection_results.agent_description?.value ??
          'You are a helpful assistant.',
        knowledgeBase: redisRes.knowledgeBase,
      },
      firstMessage: 'Hello, how can I help you today?',
    },
  },
});
console.log('Agent created', { agent: agent.agentId });

// ...
```

### Send an email to the user to notify them that their custom conversational AI agent is ready to chat

Once the agent is created, you can send an email to the user to notify them that their custom conversational AI agent is ready to chat.

```ts ./app/api/convai-webhook/route.ts
import { Resend } from 'resend';

import { EmailTemplate } from '@/components/email/post-call-webhook-email';

// ...

// Send email to user
console.log('Sending email to', redisRes.email);
await resend.emails.send({
  from: process.env.RESEND_FROM_EMAIL!,
  to: redisRes.email,
  subject: 'Your Conversational AI agent is ready to chat!',
  react: EmailTemplate({ agentId: agent.agentId }),
});

// ...
```

You can use [new.email](https://new.email/), a handy tool from the Resend team, to vibe design your email templates. Once you're happy with the template, create a new component and add in the agent ID as a prop.

```tsx ./components/email/post-call-webhook-email.tsx {14}
import {
  Body,
  Button,
  Container,
  Head,
  Html,
  Section,
  Text,
  Tailwind,

## Run the app

To run the app locally end-to-end, you will need to first run the Next.js development server, and then in a separate terminal run the ngrok tunnel to expose the webhook handler to the internet.

- Terminal 1:
  - Run `pnpm dev` to start the Next.js development server.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

- Terminal 2:
  - Run `ngrok http 3000` to expose the webhook handler to the internet.

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Now open http://localhost:3000 and start designing your custom conversational AI agent, with your voice!

## Conclusion

[ElevenLabs Conversational AI](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai) is a powerful platform for building advanced voice agent uses cases, complete with data collection and analysis.
