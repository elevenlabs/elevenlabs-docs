This guide will show you how to design a voice via a prompt using the Voice Design API.

## Using the Voice Design API

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create an API key">

    </Step>
    <Step title="Install the SDK">
        <Markdown src="/snippets/quickstart-install-sdk.mdx" />

        <Note>
            To play the audio through your speakers, you may be prompted to install [MPV](https://mpv.io/)
            and/or [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).

        Designing a voice via a prompt has two steps:

        1. Generate previews based on a prompt.
        2. Select the best preview and use it to create a new voice.

        We'll start by generating previews based on a prompt.

        Create a new file named `example.py` or `example.mts`, depending on your language of choice and add the following code:

        <CodeBlock>
        ```python maxLines=0
        # example.py
        from dotenv import load_dotenv
        from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs
        from elevenlabs import play
        import base64

        load_dotenv()

        client = ElevenLabs(
          api_key=os.getenv("ELEVENLABS_API_KEY"),
        )

        voices = client.text_to_voice.create_previews(
            voice_description="A huge giant, at least as tall as a building. A deep booming voice, loud and jolly.",
            text="Greetings little human. I am a mighty giant from a far away land. Would you like me to tell you a story?"
        )

        for preview in voices.previews:
            # Convert base64 to audio buffer
            audio_buffer = base64.b64decode(preview.audio_base_64)

            print(f"Playing preview: {preview.generated_voice_id}")

            play(audio_buffer)
        ```

        ```typescript maxLines=0
        // example.ts
        import { ElevenLabsClient, play } from "elevenlabs";
        import "dotenv/config";
        import { Readable } from 'node:stream';
        import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';

        const client = new ElevenLabsClient();

        const { previews } = await client.textToVoice.createPreviews({
            voice_description: "A huge giant, at least as tall as a building. A deep booming voice, loud and jolly.",
            text: "Greetings little human. I am a mighty giant from a far away land. Would you like me to tell you a story?",
        });

        for (const preview of previews) {
            // Convert base64 to buffer and create a Readable stream
            const audioStream = Readable.from(Buffer.from(preview.audio_base_64, 'base64'));

            console.log(`Playing preview: ${preview.generated_voice_id}`);

            // Play the audio using the stream
            await play(audioStream);
        }
        ```
        </CodeBlock>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Execute the code">
        <CodeBlock>
            ```python
            python example.py
            ```

            ```typescript
            npx tsx example.mts
            ```
        </CodeBlock>

        You should hear the generated voice previews playing through your speakers, one at a time.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add generated voice to your library">
        Once you've generated the previews and picked your favorite, you can add it to your voice library via the generated voice ID so it can be used with other APIs.

        <CodeBlock>
        ```python
        voice = client.text_to_voice.create_voice_from_preview(
            voice_name="Jolly giant",
            voice_description="A huge giant, at least as tall as a building. A deep booming voice, loud and jolly.",
            # The generated voice ID of the preview you want to use,
            # using the first in the list for this example
            generated_voice_id=voices.previews[0].generated_voice_id
        )

        print(voice.voice_id)
        ```

        ```typescript
        const voice = await client.textToVoice.createVoiceFromPreview({
            voice_name: "Jolly giant",
            voice_description: "A huge giant, at least as tall as a building. A deep booming voice, loud and jolly.",
            // The generated voice ID of the preview you want to use,
            // using the first in the list for this example
            generated_voice_id: previews[0].generated_voice_id
        });

        // The ID of the newly created voice, use this to reference the voice in other APIs
        console.log(voice.voice_id);
        ```
        </CodeBlock>
    </Step>

</Steps>
