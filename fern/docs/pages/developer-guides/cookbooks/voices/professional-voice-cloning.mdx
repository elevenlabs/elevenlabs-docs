subtitle: Learn how to clone a voice using the Clone Voice API.
---

This guide will show you how to create a Professional Voice Clone (PVC) using the PVC API. To create a PVC via the dashboard, refer to the [Professional Voice Clone](/docs/product-guides/voices/voice-cloning/professional-voice-cloning) product guide.

<Info>
  Creating a PVC requires you to be on the [Creator plan](https://elevenlabs.io/pricing) or above.
</Info>

For an outline of the differences between Instant Voice Clones and Professional Voice Clones, refer to the [Voices capability](/docs/capabilities/voices) guide.

<Warning>
  If you are unsure about what is permissible from a legal standpoint, please consult the [Terms of
  Service](https://elevenlabs.io/terms-of-use) and our [AI Safety
  information](https://elevenlabs.io/safety) for more information.
</Warning>

In terms of creating a PVC via the API, it contains considerably more steps than creating an Instant Voice Clone. This is due to the fact that PVCs are more complex and require more data and fine-tuning to create a high quality clone.

## Using the Professional Voice Clone API

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create an API key">
        <Markdown src="/snippets/quickstart-api-key.mdx" />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install the SDK">
        <Markdown src="/snippets/quickstart-install-sdk.mdx" />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a PVC voice">
        Create a new file named `example.py` or `example.mts`, depending on your language of choice and add the following code to create a PVC voice:

        <CodeBlock>
        ```python maxLines=0
        # example.py
        import os
        import time
        import base64
        from contextlib import ExitStack
        from io import BytesIO
        from dotenv import load_dotenv
        from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs

        load_dotenv()

        elevenlabs = ElevenLabs(
          api_key=os.getenv("ELEVENLABS_API_KEY"),
        )

        voice = elevenlabs.voices.pvc.create(
            name="My Professional Voice Clone",
            language="en",
            description="A professional voice clone of my voice"
        )

        print(voice)
        ```

        ```typescript maxLines=0
        // example.mts
        import { ElevenLabsClient } from "@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js";
        import "dotenv/config";
        import fs from "node:fs";

        const elevenlabs = new ElevenLabsClient();

        const voice = await elevenlabs.voices.pvc.create({
            name: "My Professional Voice Clone",
            language: "en",
            description: "A professional voice clone of my voice",
        });

        console.log(voice.voice_id);
        ```
        </CodeBlock>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Upload audio files">
        Next we'll upload the audio sample files that will be used to train the PVC. Review the [Tips and suggestions](/docs/product-guides/voices/voice-cloning/professional-voice-cloning#tips-and-suggestions) section of the PVC product guide for more information on how to get best results from your audio files.

        <CodeBlock>
        ```python maxLines=0
        # Define the list of file paths explicitly
        # Replace with the paths to your audio and/or video files.
        # The more files you add, the better the clone will be.
        sample_file_paths = [
            "/path/to/your/first_sample.mp3",
            "/path/to/your/second_sample.wav",
            "relative/path/to/another_sample.mp4"
        ]

        samples = None

        files_to_upload = []
        # Use ExitStack to manage multiple open files
        with ExitStack() as stack:
            for filepath in sample_file_paths:
                # Open each file and add it to the stack
                audio_file = stack.enter_context(open(filepath, "rb"))
                filename = os.path.basename(filepath)

                # Create a File object for the SDK
                files_to_upload.append(
                    BytesIO(audio_file.read())
                )

            samples = elevenlabs.voices.pvc.samples.create(
                voice_id=voice.voice_id,
                files=files_to_upload # Pass the list of File objects
            )
        ```

        ```typescript
        const samples = await elevenlabs.voices.pvc.samples.create(voice.voice_id, {
            // Replace with the paths to your audio and/or video files.
            // The more files you add, the better the clone will be.
            files: [fs.createReadStream("/path/to/your/audio/file.mp3")],
        })
        ```
        </CodeBlock>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Begin speaker separation">
        This step will attempt to separate the audio files into individual speakers. This is required if you are uploading audio with multiple speakers.

        <CodeBlock>
        ```python maxLines=0
        sample_ids_to_check = []
        for sample in samples:
            if sample.sample_id:
                print(f"Starting separation for sample: {sample.sample_id}")
                elevenlabs.voices.pvc.samples.speakers.separate(
                    voice_id=voice.voice_id,
                    sample_id=sample.sample_id
                )
                sample_ids_to_check.append(sample.sample_id)

        while sample_ids_to_check:
            # Create a copy of the list to iterate over, so we can remove items from the original
            ids_in_batch = list(sample_ids_to_check)
            for sample_id in ids_in_batch:
                status_response = elevenlabs.voices.pvc.samples.speakers.get(
                    voice_id=voice.voice_id,
                    sample_id=sample_id
                )
                status = status_response.status
                print(f"Sample {sample_id} status: {status}")
                if status == "completed" or status == "failed":
                    sample_ids_to_check.remove(sample_id)

            if sample_ids_to_check:
                # Wait before the next poll cycle
                time.sleep(5) # Wait for 5 seconds

        print("All samples have been processed or removed from polling.")
        ```

        ```typescript maxLines=0
        // Trigger the speaker separation action, this will take some time to complete
        for (const sample of samples) {
            if (sample.sample_id) {
                await elevenlabs.voices.pvc.samples.speakers.separate(voiceId, sample.sampleId);
            }
        }

        // Check the status of the speaker separation action
        const ids = samples.map((sample) => sample.sample_id);
        const interval = setInterval(async () => {
            // Poll the status of the speaker separation action
            for (const id of ids) {
                if (!id) continue;

                const { status } = await elevenlabs.voices.pvc.samples.speakers.get(voice.voiceId, id);
                console.log(`Sample ${id} status: ${status}`);
                if (status === "completed" || status === "failed") {
                    ids.splice(ids.indexOf(id), 1);
                }

                if (ids.length === 0) {
                    clearInterval(interval);
                    console.log("All samples have been processed or removed from polling");
                }
            }
        }, 5000);
        ```
        </CodeBlock>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Retrieve speaker audio">
        <Warning>
            Since the previous step will take some time to complete, the following step should be run in a separate process after the previous step has completed.
        </Warning>

        Once speaker separation is complete, you will have a list of speakers for each sample. In the case of samples with multiple speakers, you will have to pick the speaker you want to use for the PVC. To identify the speaker, you can retrieve the audio for each speaker and listen to them.

        <CodeBlock>
        ```python maxLines=0
        # Get the list of samples from the voice created in Step 3
        voice = elevenlabs.voices.get(voice_id=voice_id)

        samples = voice.samples

        # Loop over each sample and save the audio for each speaker to a file
        speaker_audio_output_dir = "path/to/speakers/"
        if not os.path.exists(speaker_audio_output_dir):
            os.makedirs(speaker_audio_output_dir)

        for sample in samples:
            speaker_info = elevenlabs.voices.pvc.samples.speakers.get(
                voice_id=voice.voice_id,
                sample_id=sample.sample_id
            )

            # Proceed only if separation is actually complete
            if getattr(speaker_info, 'status', 'unknown') != "completed":
                continue

            if hasattr(speaker_info, 'speakers') and speaker_info.speakers:
                speaker_list = speaker_info.speakers
                if isinstance(speaker_info.speakers, dict):
                    speaker_list = speaker_info.speakers.values()

                for speaker in speaker_list:
                    audio_response = elevenlabs.voices.pvc.samples.speakers.audio.get(
                        voice_id=voice.voice_id,
                        sample_id=sample.sample_id,
                        speaker_id=speaker.speaker_id
                    )

                    audio_base64 = audio_response.audio_base_64
                    audio_data = base64.b64decode(audio_base64)
                    output_filename = os.path.join(speaker_audio_output_dir, f"sample_{sample.sample_id}_speaker_{speaker.speaker_id}.mp3")

                    with open(output_filename, "wb") as f:
                        f.write(audio_data)
        ```

        ```typescript maxLines=0
        // Get the list of samples from the voice created in Step 3
        const { samples } = await elevenlabs.voices.get(voiceId);

        // After separation is completed, get the list of speakers and their audio
        if (samples) {
            for (const sample of samples) {
                if (!sample.sampleId) continue;

                const { speakers } = await elevenlabs.voices.pvc.samples.speakers.get(voiceId, sample.sampleId)

                if (speakers) {
                    for (const speaker of Object.values(speakers)) {
                        if (!speaker || !speaker.speakerId) continue;
                        const { audioBase64 } = await elevenlabs.voices.pvc.samples.speakers.audio.get(voiceId, sample.sampleId, speaker.speakerId);
                        const audioBuffer = Buffer.from(audioBase64, 'base64');

                        // Write the audio to a file
                        // Note which speaker ID you wish to use for the PVC
                        fs.writeFileSync(`path/to/speakers/sample_${sample.sampleId}_speaker_${speaker.speakerId}.mp3`, audioBuffer);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        ```
        </CodeBlock>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Update samples with speaker IDs">
        Once speaker separation is complete, you can update the samples to select which speaker you want to use for the PVC.

        <CodeBlock>
        ```python
        elevenlabs.voices.pvc.samples.update(
            voice_id=voice.voice_id,
            sample_id=sample.sample_id,
            selected_speaker_ids=[speaker.speaker_id]
        )
        ```
        ```typescript
        await elevenlabs.voices.pvc.samples.update(voice.voiceId, samples.sampleId, {
            selectedSpeakerIds: [speaker.speakerId],
        })
        ```

        Repeat this process for each sample for with multiple speakers.
        </CodeBlock>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify the PVC">
        Before training can begin, a verification step is required to ensure you have permission to use the voice. First request the verification CAPTCHA.

        <CodeBlock>
        ```python
        captcha_response = elevenlabs.voices.pvc.verification.captcha.get(voice.voice_id)

        # Save captcha image to file
        captcha_buffer = base64.b64decode(captcha_response)
        with open('captcha.png', 'wb') as f:
            f.write(captcha_buffer)
        ```

        ```typescript
        const captchaResponse = await elevenlabs.voices.pvc.verification.captcha.get(voice.voice_id);

        // Save captcha image to file
        const captchaBuffer = Buffer.from(captchaResponse, 'base64');
        fs.writeFileSync('path/to/captcha.png', captchaBuffer);
        ```
        </CodeBlock>

        The image contains several lines of text that the voice owner will need to read out loud and record. Once done, submit the recording to verify the identity of the voice's owner.

        <CodeBlock>
        ```python
        elevenlabs.voices.pvc.verification.captcha.verify(
            voice_id=voice.voice_id,
            recording=open('path/to/recording.mp3', 'rb')
        )
        ```
        ```typescript
        await elevenlabs.voices.pvc.verification.captcha.verify(voice.voiceId, {
        	recording: fs.createReadStream("/path/to/recording.mp3"),
        })
        ```
        </CodeBlock>
    </Step>
    <Step title="(Optional) Request manual verification">
        If you are unable to verify the CAPTCHA, you can request manual verification. Note that this will take longer to process.

        This should only be used if the previous verification steps have failed or are not possible, for instance if the voice owner is visually impaired.

        For a list of the files that are required for manual verification, please contact support as each case may be unique.

        <CodeBlock>
        ```python
        elevenlabs.voices.pvc.verification.request(
            voice_id=voice.voice_id,
            files=[open('path/to/verification/files.txt', 'rb')],
        )
        ```

        ```typescript
        await elevenlabs.voices.pvc.verification.request(voice.voiceId, {
            files: [fs.createReadStream("/path/to/verification/files.txt")],
        });
        ```
        </CodeBlock>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Train the PVC">
        Next, begin the training process. This will take some time to complete based on the length and number of samples provided.

        <CodeBlock>
        ```python maxLines=0
        elevenlabs.voices.pvc.train(
            voice_id=voice.voice_id,
            # Specify the model the PVC should be trained on
            model_id="eleven_multilingual_v2"
        )

        # Poll the fine tuning status until it is complete or fails
        # This example specifically checks for the eleven_multilingual_v2 model
        while True:
            voice_details = elevenlabs.voices.get(voice_id=voice.voice_id)
            fine_tuning_state = None
            if voice_details.fine_tuning and voice_details.fine_tuning.state:
                fine_tuning_state = voice_details.fine_tuning.state.get("eleven_multilingual_v2")

            if fine_tuning_state:
                progress = None
                if voice_details.fine_tuning.progress and voice_details.fine_tuning.progress.get("eleven_multilingual_v2"):
                    progress = voice_details.fine_tuning.progress.get("eleven_multilingual_v2")
                print(f"Fine tuning progress: {progress}")

                if fine_tuning_state == "fine_tuned" or fine_tuning_state == "failed":
                    print("Fine tuning completed or failed")
                    break
            # Wait for 5 seconds before polling again
            time.sleep(5)
        ```

        ```typescript maxLines=0
        await elevenlabs.voices.pvc.train(voiceId, {
            // Specify the model the PVC should be trained on
            modelId: "eleven_multilingual_v2",
        });

        // Poll the fine tuning status until it is complete or fails
        // This example specifically checks for the eleven_multilingual_v2 model
        const interval = setInterval(async () => {
            const { fineTuning } = await elevenlabs.voices.get(voiceId);
            if (!fineTuning) return;

            console.log(`Fine tuning progress: ${fineTuning?.progress?.eleven_multilingual_v2}`);

            if (fineTuning?.state?.eleven_multilingual_v2 === "fine_tuned" || fineTuning?.state?.eleven_multilingual_v2 === "failed") {
                clearInterval(interval);
                console.log("Fine tuning completed or failed");
            }
        }, 5000);
        ```
        </CodeBlock>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Use the newly created voice">
        Once the PVC is verified, you can use it in the same way as any other voice. See the [Text to Speech quickstart](/docs/quickstart) for more information on how to use a voice.
