This guide will show you how to create an entirely new voice by remixing an existing one.

<Warning>
  Remixing is only possible with the Eleven v3 model. Eleven v3 API access is currently not publicly
  available, but will be soon. To request access, please [contact our sales
  team](https://elevenlabs.io/contact-sales).
</Warning>

## Using the Voice Design API

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create an API key">
        <Markdown src="/snippets/quickstart-api-key.mdx" />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install the SDK">
        <Markdown src="/snippets/quickstart-install-sdk.mdx" />

        <Note>
            To play the audio through your speakers, you may be prompted to install [MPV](https://mpv.io/)
            and/or [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Make the API request">
        Remixing a voice is a two step process:

        1. Generate a preview of the new voice by providing a voice ID and a prompt.
        2. Create the new voice from the preview.

        We'll start by generating a preview of the new voice.

        Create a new file named `example.py` or `example.mts`, depending on your language of choice and add the following code:

        <Warning>
            You can only remix voices that were created by you. For example previously designed voices, IVC or PVC voices. You cannot remix voices from the voice library.
        </Warning>

        <CodeBlocks>
            ```python maxLines=0
            # example.py
            from dotenv import load_dotenv
            from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs
            from elevenlabs import play
            import base64

            load_dotenv()

            elevenlabs = ElevenLabs(
                api_key=os.getenv("ELEVENLABS_API_KEY"),
            )

            voices = elevenlabs.text_to_voice.remix(
                voice_id="JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb"
                voice_description="Use a higher pitch and change to a Boston accent.",
                text="Of course I'm a Bostonian, I've lived here all my life!",
            )

            for preview in voices.previews:
                # Convert base64 to audio buffer
                audio_buffer = base64.b64decode(preview.audio_base_64)

                print(f"Playing preview: {preview.generated_voice_id}")

                play(audio_buffer)
            ```

            ```typescript maxLines=0
            // example.ts
            import { ElevenLabsClient, play } from "@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js";
            import "dotenv/config";
            import { Readable } from 'node:stream';
            import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';

            const elevenlabs = new ElevenLabsClient();

            const { previews } = await elevenlabs.textToVoice.remix("JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb", {
                voiceDescription: "Use a higher pitch and change to a Boston accent.",
                text: "Of course I'm a Bostonian, I've lived here all my life!",
            });

            for (const preview of previews) {
                // Convert base64 to buffer and create a Readable stream
                const audioStream = Readable.from(Buffer.from(preview.audioBase64, 'base64'));

                console.log(`Playing preview: ${preview.generatedVoiceId}`);

                // Play the audio using the stream
                await play(audioStream);
            }
            ```
        </CodeBlocks>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Execute the code">
        <CodeBlocks>
            ```python
            python example.py
            ```

            ```typescript
            npx tsx example.mts
            ```
        </CodeBlocks>

        You should hear the generated voice previews playing through your speakers, one at a time.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add generated voice to your library">
        Once you've generated the previews and picked your favorite, you can add it to your voice library via the generated voice ID so it can be used with other APIs.

        <CodeBlocks>
        ```python
        voice = elevenlabs.text_to_voice.create(
            voice_name="Bostonian",
            voice_description="A high pitched Bostonian accent.",
            # The generated voice ID of the preview you want to use,
            # using the first in the list for this example
            generated_voice_id=voices.previews[0].generated_voice_id
        )

        print(voice.voice_id)
        ```

        ```typescript
        const voice = await elevenlabs.textToVoice.create({
            voiceName: "Bostonian",
            voiceDescription: "A high pitched Bostonian accent.",
            // The generated voice ID of the preview you want to use,
            // using the first in the list for this example
            generatedVoiceId: previews[0].generatedVoiceId
        });

        // The ID of the newly created voice, use this to reference the voice in other APIs
        console.log(voice.voiceId);
        ```
        </CodeBlocks>
    </Step>

</Steps>
