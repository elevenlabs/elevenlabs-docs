## Using the Clone Voice API

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create an API key">
        <Markdown src="/snippets/quickstart-api-key.mdx" />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install the SDK">
        <Markdown src="/snippets/quickstart-install-sdk.mdx" />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Make the API request">
        Create a new file named `example.py` or `example.mts`, depending on your language of choice and add the following code:

        <CodeBlocks>
        ```python maxLines=0
        # example.py
        import os
        from dotenv import load_dotenv
        from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs
        from io import BytesIO

        load_dotenv()

        elevenlabs = ElevenLabs(
          api_key=os.getenv("ELEVENLABS_API_KEY"),
        )

        voice = elevenlabs.voices.add(
            name="My Voice Clone",
            # Replace with the paths to your audio files.
            # The more files you add, the better the clone will be.
            files=[BytesIO(open("/path/to/your/audio/file.mp3", "rb").read())]
        )

        print(voice.voice_id)
        ```

        ```typescript maxLines=0
        // example.mts
        import { ElevenLabsClient } from "@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js";
        import "dotenv/config";
        import fs from "node:fs";

        const elevenlabs = new ElevenLabsClient();

        const voice = await elevenlabs.voices.add({
            name: "My Voice Clone",
            // Replace with the paths to your audio files.
            // The more files you add, the better the clone will be.
            files: [
                fs.createReadStream(
                    "/path/to/your/audio/file.mp3",
                ),
            ],
        });

        console.log(voice.voice_id);
        ```
        </CodeBlocks>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Execute the code">
        <CodeBlocks>
            ```python
            python example.py
            ```

            ```typescript
            npx tsx example.mts
            ```
        </CodeBlocks>

        You should see the voice ID printed to the console.
    </Step>

</Steps>
