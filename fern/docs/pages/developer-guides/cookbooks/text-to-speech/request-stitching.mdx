title: Stitching multiple requests
subtitle: Learn how to maintain voice prosody over multiple chunks/generations.
---

When converting a large body of text into audio, you may encounter abrupt changes in prosody from one chunk to another. This can be particularly noticeable when converting text that spans multiple paragraphs or sections. In order to maintain voice prosody over multiple chunks, you can use the Request Stitching feature.

This feature allows you to provide context on what has already been generated and what will be generated in the future, helping to maintain a consistent voice and prosody throughout the entire text.

Here's an example without Request Stitching:

And the same example with Request Stitching:

<video
  controls
  className="w-full"
  src="https://eleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io/audio/docs/with_request_stitching.mp3"
  style={{ height: 60 }}
></video>

## How to use Request Stitching

Request Stitching is easiest when using the ElevenLabs SDKs.

        Create a new file named `example.py` or `example.mts`, depending on your language of choice and add the following code:

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="How does Request Stitching work with streaming?">
        In order to use the request IDs of a previous request for conditioning it needs to have processed completely. In case of streaming this means the audio has to be read completely from the response body.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="How much difference does Request Stitching make?">
        The difference depends on the model, voice and voice settings used.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="How old can the request IDs be?">
        The request IDs should be no older than two hours.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Is Request Stitching available on every plan?">
        Yes, unless you are an enterprise user with increased privacy requirements.
