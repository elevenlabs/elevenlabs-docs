## Overview

<script src="https://elevenlabs.io/player/audioNativeHelper.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

ElevenLabs [sound effects](/docs/api-reference/text-to-sound-effects/convert) API turns text descriptions into high-quality audio effects with precise control over timing, style and complexity. The model understands both natural language and audio terminology, enabling you to:

- Generate cinematic sound design for films & trailers
- Create custom sound effects for games & interactive media
- Produce Foley and ambient sounds for video content

Listen to an example:

<elevenlabs-audio-player
audio-title="Cinematic braam"
audio-src="https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-docs/raw/refs/heads/main/fern/assets/audio/sfx-cinematic-braam.mp3"
/>

## Usage

Sound effects are generated using text descriptions & two optional parameters:

- **Duration**: Set a specific length for the generated audio (in seconds)

  - Default: Automatically determined based on the prompt
  - Range: 0.1 to 22 seconds
  - Cost: 40 credits per second when duration is specified

- **Prompt influence**: Control how strictly the model follows the prompt

  - High: More literal interpretation of the prompt
  - Low: More creative interpretation with added variations

### Prompting guide

#### Simple effects

For basic sound effects, use clear, concise descriptions:

- "Glass shattering on concrete"
- "Heavy wooden door creaking open"
- "Thunder rumbling in the distance"

<elevenlabs-audio-player
    audio-title="Wood chopping"
    audio-src="https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-docs/raw/refs/heads/main/fern/assets/audio/sfx-wood-chopping.mp3"
/>

#### Complex sequences

For multi-part sound effects, describe the sequence of events:

- "Footsteps on gravel, then a metallic door opens"
- "Wind whistling through trees, followed by leaves rustling"
- "Sword being drawn, then clashing with another blade"

<elevenlabs-audio-player
    audio-title="Walking and then falling"
    audio-src="https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-docs/raw/refs/heads/main/fern/assets/audio/sfx-walking-falling.mp3"
/>

#### Musical elements

The API also supports generation of musical components:

- "90s hip-hop drum loop, 90 BPM"
- "Vintage brass stabs in F minor"
- "Atmospheric synth pad with subtle modulation"

<elevenlabs-audio-player
    audio-title="90s drum loop"
    audio-src="https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-docs/raw/refs/heads/main/fern/assets/audio/sfx-90s-drum-loop.mp3"
/>

#### Audio Terminology

Common terms that can enhance your prompts:

- **Impact**: Collision or contact sounds between objects, from subtle taps to dramatic crashes
- **Whoosh**: Movement through air effects, ranging from fast and ghostly to slow-spinning or rhythmic
- **Ambience**: Background environmental sounds that establish atmosphere and space
- **One-shot**: Single, non-repeating sound
- **Loop**: Repeating audio segment
- **Stem**: Isolated audio component
- **Braam**: Big, brassy cinematic hit that signals epic or dramatic moments, common in trailers
- **Glitch**: Sounds of malfunction, jittering, or erratic movement, useful for transitions and sci-fi
- **Drone**: Continuous, textured sound that creates atmosphere and suspense

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the maximum duration for generated effects?">
    The maximum duration is 22 seconds per generation. For longer sequences, generate multiple
    effects and combine them.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I generate music with this API?">
    Yes, you can generate musical elements like drum loops, bass lines, and melodic samples.
    However, for full music production, consider combining multiple generated elements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I ensure consistent quality?">
    Use detailed prompts, appropriate duration settings, and high prompt influence for more
    predictable results. For complex sounds, generate components separately and combine them.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What audio formats are supported?">
    Generated audio is provided in MP3 format with professional-grade quality (44.1kHz,
    128-192kbps).
