## Overview

ElevenLabs [voice changer](/docs/api-reference/speech-to-speech/convert) API lets you transform any source audio (recorded or uploaded) into a different, fully cloned voice without losing the performance nuances of the original. It’s capable of capturing whispers, laughs, cries, accents, and subtle emotional cues to achieve a highly realistic, human feel and can be used to:

- Change any voice while preserving emotional delivery and nuance
- Create consistent character voices across multiple languages and recording sessions
- Fix or replace specific words and phrases in existing recordings

- Maintain appropriate microphone levels - avoid too quiet or peaked audio
- Use `remove_background_noise=true` if environmental sounds are present

### Recording guidelines

- Keep segments under 5 minutes for optimal processing
- Feel free to include natural expressions (laughs, sighs, emotions)
- The source audio's accent and language will be preserved in the output

### Parameters

- **Style**: Set to 0% when input audio is already expressive
- **Stability**: Use 100% for maximum voice consistency
- **Language**: Choose source audio that matches your desired accent and language

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Can I convert more than 5 minutes of audio?">
  Yes, but you must split it into smaller chunks (each under 5 minutes). This helps ensure stability
  and consistent output.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use my own custom/cloned voice for output?">
  Absolutely. Provide your custom voice’s <code>voice_id</code> and specify the correct{' '}
  <code>model_id</code>.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is billing handled?">
  You’re charged at 1000 characters’ worth of usage per minute of processed audio. There’s no
  additional fee based on file size.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does the model reproduce background noise?">
  Possibly. Use <code>remove_background_noise=true</code> or the Voice Isolator tool to minimize
  environmental sounds in the final output.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which model is best for English audio?">
  Though <code>eleven_english_sts_v2</code> is available, our{' '}
  <code>eleven_multilingual_sts_v2</code> model often outperforms it, even for English material.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does style & stability work?">
  “Style” adds interpretative flair; “stability” enforces consistency. For high-energy performances
  in the source audio, turn style down and stability up.
