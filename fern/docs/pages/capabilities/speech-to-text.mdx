## State of the art accuracy

The Scribe v1 model is capable of transcribing audio from up to 16 speakers with high accuracy. Optionally it can also transcribe audio events like laughter, applause, and other non-speech sounds.

The output is classified in three category types:

- `word` - A word in the language of the audio
- `spacing` - The space between words, not applicable for languages that don't use spaces like Japanese, Mandarin, Thai, Lao, Burmese and Cantonese.
- `audio_event` - Non-speech sounds like laughter or applause. Also includes verbatim noises like "um" or "ah".
