## Overview

The ElevenLabs [Forced Alignment](/docs/api-reference/forced-alignment) API turns spoken audio and text into a time-aligned transcript. This is useful for cases where you have audio recording and a transcript, but need exact timestamps for each word or phrase in the transcript. This can be used for:

- Matching subtitles to a video recording
- Generating timings for an audiobook recording of an ebook

## Usage

The Forced Alignment API can be used by interfacing with the ElevenLabs API directly.
