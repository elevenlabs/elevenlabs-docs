## Overview

ElevenLabs [Text to Speech (TTS)](/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech) API turns text into lifelike audio with nuanced intonation, pacing and emotional awareness. [Our models](/docs/models) adapt to textual cues across 32 languages and multiple voice styles and can be used to:

- Narrate global media campaigns & ads
- Produce audiobooks in multiple languages with complex emotional delivery
- Stream real-time audio from text

Listen to a sample:

<elevenlabs-audio-player
    audio-title="George"
    audio-src="https://storage.googleapis.com/eleven-public-cdn/audio/marketing/george.mp3"
/>

Explore our [voice library](https://elevenlabs.io/community) to find the perfect voice for your project.

### Voice quality

For real-time applications, Flash v2.5 provides ultra-low 75ms latency, while Multilingual v2 delivers the highest quality audio with more nuanced expression.

### Voice options

ElevenLabs offers thousands of voices across 32 languages through multiple creation methods:

- [Voice library](/docs/capabilities/voices) with 3,000+ community-shared voices
- [Professional voice cloning](/docs/capabilities/voices#cloned) for highest-fidelity replicas
- [Instant voice cloning](/docs/capabilities/voices#cloned) for quick voice replication
- [Voice design](/docs/capabilities/voices#voice-design) to generate custom voices from text descriptions

Learn more about our [voice options](/docs/capabilities/voices).

### Supported languages

<Markdown src="/snippets/v2-model-languages.mdx" />

<Markdown src="/snippets/v2-5-model-languages.mdx" />

Simply input text in any of our supported languages and select a matching voice from our [voice library](https://elevenlabs.io/community). For the most natural results, choose a voice with an accent that matches your target language and region.

### Prompting

The models interpret emotional context directly from the text input. For example, adding
descriptive text like "she said excitedly" or using exclamation marks will influence the speech
emotion. Voice settings like Stability and Similarity help control the consistency, while the
underlying emotion comes from textual cues.

Read the [prompting guide](/docs/best-practices/prompting) for more details.

<Note>
  Descriptive text will be spoken out by the model and must be manually trimmed or removed from the
  audio if desired.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I clone my own voice?">
    Yes, you can create [instant voice clones](/docs/capabilities/voices#cloned) of your own voice
    from short audio clips. For high-fidelity clones, check out our [professional voice
    cloning](/docs/capabilities/voices#cloned) feature.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I own the audio output?">
    Yes. You retain ownership of any audio you generate. However, commercial usage rights are only
    available with paid plans. With a paid subscription, you may use generated audio for commercial
    purposes and monetize the outputs if you own the IP rights to the input content.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What qualifies as a free regeneration?">
    A free regeneration allows you to regenerate the same text to speech content without additional cost, subject to these conditions:

    - You can regenerate each piece of content up to 2 times for free
    - The content must be exactly the same as the previous generation. Any changes to the text, voice settings, or other parameters will require a new, paid generation

    Free regenerations are useful in case there is a slight distortion in the audio output. According to ElevenLabs' internal benchmarks, regenerations will solve roughly half of issues with quality, with remaining issues usually due to poor training data.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I reduce latency for real-time cases?">
    Use the low-latency Flash [models](/docs/models) (Flash v2 or v2.5) optimized for near real-time
    conversational or interactive scenarios. See our [latency optimization
    guide](/docs/best-practices/latency-optimization) for more details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why is my output sometimes inconsistent?">
    The models are nondeterministic. For consistency, use the optional [seed
    parameter](/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech/convert#request.body.seed), though subtle
    differences may still occur.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the best practice for large text conversions?">
    Split long text into segments and use streaming for real-time playback and efficient processing.
    To maintain natural prosody flow between chunks, include [previous/next text or previous/next
    request id parameters](/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech/convert#request.body.previous_text).
