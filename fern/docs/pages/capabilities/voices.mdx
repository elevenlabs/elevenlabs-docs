#### Voice design

With [Voice Design](/docs/product-guides/voices/voice-design), you can create entirely new voices by specifying attributes like age, gender, accent, and tone. Generated voices are ideal for:

- Realistic voices with nuanced characteristics.
- Creative character voices for games and storytelling.

The voice design tool creates 3 voice previews, simply provide:

- A **voice description** between 20 and 1000 characters.
- A **text** to preview the voice between 100 and 1000 characters.

#### Voice design with Eleven v3 (alpha)

Using the new [Eleven v3 model](/docs/models#eleven-v3-alpha), voices that are capable of a wide range of emotion can be designed via a prompt.

Using v3 gets you the following benefits:

- More natural and versatile voice generation.
- Better control over voice characteristics.
- Audio tags supported in Preview generations.
- Backward compatibility with v2 models.

<Note>
  Voice design with v3 is currently in alpha. It is only available in the dashboard, with API access
  coming soon.

Our curated set of default voices is optimized for core use cases. These voices are:

- **Reliable**: Available long-term.
- **Consistent**: Carefully crafted and quality-checked for performance.
- **Model-ready**: Fine-tuned on new models upon release.

<Info>
  Default voices are available to all users via the **my voices** tab in the [voice lab
  dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/voice-lab). Default voices were previously referred to as
  `premade` voices. The latter term is still used when accessing default voices via the API.

### Managing voices

All voices can be managed through **My Voices**, where you can:

- Search, filter, and categorize voices
- Add descriptions and custom tags
- Organize voices for quick access

Learn how to manage your voice collection in [My Voices documentation](/docs/product-guides/voices/voice-library).

- **Search and Filter**: Find voices using keywords or tags.
- **Preview Samples**: Listen to voice demos before adding them to **My Voices**.
- **Add to Collection**: Save voices for easy access in your projects.

> **Tip**: Try searching by specific accents or genres, such as "Australian narration" or "child-like character."

### Supported languages

All ElevenLabs voices support multiple languages. Experiment by converting phrases like `Hello! こんにちは! Bonjour!` into speech to hear how your own voice sounds across different languages.

ElevenLabs supports voice creation in 32 languages. Match your voice selection to your target region for the most natural results.

- **Default Voices**: Optimized for multilingual use.
- **Generated and Cloned Voices**: Accent fidelity depends on input samples or selected attributes.
