## Overview

ElevenLabs [dubbing](/docs/api-reference/dubbing/create) API translates audio and video across 32 languages while preserving the emotion, timing, tone and unique characteristics of each speaker. Our model separates each speaker’s dialogue from the soundtrack, allowing you to recreate the original delivery in another language. It can be used to:

- Grow your addressable audience by 4x to reach international audiences
- Adapt existing material for new markets while preserving emotional nuance
- Offer content in multiple languages without re-recording voice talent
