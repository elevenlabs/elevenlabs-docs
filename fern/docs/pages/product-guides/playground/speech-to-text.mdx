## Overview

With speech to text, you can transcribe spoken audio into text with state of the art accuracy. With automatic language detection, you can transcribe audio in a multitude of languages.

## Creating a transcript

<Steps>
    <Step title="Upload audio">
        In the ElevenLabs dashboard, navigate to the Speech to Text page and click the "Transcribe files" button. From the modal, you can upload an audio or video file to transcribe.

        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Select options">
        Select the primary language of the audio and the maximum number of speakers. If you don't know either, you can leave the defaults which will attempt to detect the language and number of speakers automatically.

        Finally choose whether you wish to tag audio events like laughter or applause, then click the "Transcribe" button.
    </Step>
    <Step title="View results">
        Click on the name of the audio file you uploaded in the center pane to view the results. You can click on a word to start a playback of the audio at that point.

        Click the "Export" button in the top right to download the results in a variety of formats.
    </Step>

</Steps>
