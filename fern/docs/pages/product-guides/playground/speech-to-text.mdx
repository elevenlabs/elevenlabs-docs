    <Step title="Select options">
        Select the primary language of the audio and the maximum number of speakers. If you don't know either, you can leave the defaults which will attempt to detect the language and number of speakers automatically.

        Finally choose whether you wish to tag audio events like laughter or applause, then click the "Transcribe" button.

        Click on the name of the audio file you uploaded in the center pane to view the results. You can click on a word to start a playback of the audio at that point.
