## Overview

The [Payouts](https://elevenlabs.io/payouts) system allows you to earn rewards for sharing voices in the [Voice library](/docs/product-guides/voices/voice-library). ElevenLabs uses <a href="https://stripe.com/connect">Stripe Connect</a> to process reward payouts.

- Follow the prompts from Stripe Connect to complete the account setup.

## Tracking usage and earnings

- You can track the usage of your voices by going to ["My Voices"](/app/voice-lab), clicking "View" to open the detailed view for your voice, then clicking the sharing icon at the bottom. Once you have the Sharing Options open, click "View Metrics".
- The rewards you earn are based on the options you selected when [sharing your voice in the Voice Library](/docs/product-guides/voices/voice-library#sharing-voices).
- You can also see your all-time earnings and past payouts by going back to your Payouts page.

## Reader app rewards

- If your voice is marked as **[High-Quality](/docs/product-guides/voices/voice-library#category)** and you have activated the "Available in ElevenReader" toggle, your voice will made be available in the [ElevenReader app](/text-reader). Rewards for ElevenReader are reported separately â€“ to view your Reader App rewards, check the "ElevenReader" box on your "View Metrics" screen.

## Things to know

- Rewards accumulate frequently throughout the day, but payouts typically happen once a week as long as you have an active paid subscription and your accrued payouts exceed the minimum threshold. In most cases this is $10, but some countries may have a higher threshold.

- You can see your past payouts by going to your [Payouts](/app/payouts) page in the sidebar.

## Supported countries

- Currently, Stripe Connect is not supported in all countries. We are constantly working to expand our reach for Payouts and plan to add availability in more countries when possible.
