## Overview

The [Voice Library](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library) (VL) is a marketplace where our community can share voices and earn rewards when they're used. At the moment, only Professional Voice Clones (PVCs) can be shared in the library. Instant Voice Clones (IVCs) cannot be shared for safety reasons.

## Using voices from the Voice Library

You can play a sample for any voice in the Voice Library by clicking it.

To use a voice from the Voice Library, you first need to add it to My Voices. To do this, click "Add". This will save it to My Voices using the default name for the voice. You can use it directly from the Voice Library by clicking "Use", which will open Speech Synthesis with the voice selected.

Once the voice has been added to My Voices, it will appear in the voice selection menu across all features.

## Details view

You can find out more information about a voice by clicking "View". This opens up a pane on the right which contains more information. Here you can see all the tags associated with the voice, including:

- the language it was trained on
- the age and gender of the voice
- the category, for example, "Conversational"
- how long the notice period is, if the voice has one
- if the voice has been labelled as High Quality
- what type of voice it is, for example, Professional Voice Clone

You can also see how many users have saved the voice to My Voices, and how many characters of audio have been generated with the voice.

Finally, you can also see suggestions of similar voices, and can play samples and add these to My Voices if you want.

### Category

Some labels tell you about the type of voice:

</Card>
<Card title="HQ">
  The HQ label stands for High Quality, and indicates that this Professional Voice Clone has been
  trained on audio which follows our **[Professional Recording
  Guidelines](/docs/product/voices/voice-lab/professional-voice-cloning)** and has passed a quality
  control check on input texts of various lengths.
</Card>

### Sharing Options

Other labels tell you about options the voice owner set when sharing the voice. Please see the **[Sharing](/docs/product/voices/voice-library/sharing)** page for more details.

  <p>
    A label with a clock icon indicates that the voice has a Notice Period in place. The Notice
    Period lets you now how long you'll continue to have access to the voice if the voice owner
    decides to remove it from the Voice Library.
  </p>
</Card>
<Card title="Credit Multiplier">
  Some voices have a credit multiplier in place. This is shown by a label displaying, for example,
  x2 multiplier or x3 multiplier. This means that the voice owner has set a custom rate for use of
  their voice. Please pay close attention, as credit multipliers mean your account will be deducted
  &gt;1x the number of credits when you generate using a voice that has a credit multiplier.

  Some voices have "Live Moderation" enabled. This is indicated with a label with a shield icon.
  When you generate using a voice with Live Moderation enabled, we use tools to check whether the
  text being generated belongs to a number of prohibited categories. This may introduce extra
  latency when using the voice, and voices with Live Moderation enabled cannot be used in Projects.

## Filters, Sorting, and Search

To help you find the perfect voice for you, the Voice Library is searchable and filterable.

### Search box

You can use the search box to search by name, keyword and voice ID. You can also search by dragging and dropping an audio file, or uploading a file by clicking the upload icon. This will return the voice used, if it can be found, along with similar voices.

### Sort by

You have a number of options for sorting voices in the Voice Library:

- Trending: voices are ranked by our trending algorithm
- Latest: newest voices are shown first
- Most users
- Most characters generated

### Language filter

The language filter allows you to return only voices that have been trained on audio in a specific language. While all voices are compatible with our multilingual models and can therefore be used with all 32 languages we support, voices labelled with a specific language should perform well for content in that language

### Accent filter

If you select a specific language, the Accent filter will also become available. This allows you to look for voices with specific accents.

### More filters

Click the "More filters" button to access additional filters.

#### Category

- Voice Design
- Professional
- High-Quality

#### Gender

- Male
- Female
- Neutral

#### Age

- Young
- Middle Aged
- Old

#### Use case

You can click the use case of your choice to show only voices that have been labelled with this use case.

#### Voice Notice Periods

When voice creators remove voices from the library, users who have added these voices to their "My Voices" collection receive advance notice through email and in-app notifications. These notifications:
Specify when the voice will become unavailable
Recommend similar alternative voices from the library
This notice period, determined by the voice creator, ensures users have time to transition to new voices and maintain continuity in their projects.

## How to share a voice model in the Voice Library:

**1. Share Button:** To get started with sharing a voice model, find the voice model you want to share in <a href="/docs/product/voices/voice-lab/overview">My Voices</a> and click the share icon:

**2. Sharing Toggle:** Next, activate sharing by enabling the "Sharing" toggle. Note that this doesn’t make your voice model automatically discoverable in the Voice Library.

**3. Sharing Link/Email Whitelist:** Once the "Sharing" toggle is enabled, you have a few ways to share your Voice Model:

- **Sharing Link:** share this link with your audience, your friends, or anyone else that you want to be able to make a copy of your voice model in My Voices.
- **Email Whitelist:** you can specify specific emails to restrict who can make copies of your voice model in My Voices using your Sharing Link. If you leave the whitelist blank, all emails will be enabled by default.
- **Discovery in Voice Library:** this makes your voice model discoverable in the Voice Library and takes you to the sharing dialog detailed in Step 4 below.

**4. Library Sharing Options:** if you enable "Discovery in Voice Library", you’ll be brought to a dialog screen where you can configure a few options for sharing your voice model in the Voice Library:

Please see the [Voice Library Addendum](https://elevenlabs.io/vla) to our Terms of Service for full descriptions of these options.

**5. Naming Guidelines:** Please ensure the name you give your voice model adheres to the guidelines shown in the sharing dialog:

- The naming pattern should be a one-word name followed by a 2-4 word description, separated by a hyphen (-).

- Your name should NOT include the following:

  - Names of public individuals or entities (company names, band names, influencers or famous people, etc).
  - Social handles (Twitter, Instagram, you name it, etc).
  - ALL CAPS WORDS.
  - Emojis and any other non-letter characters.
  - Explicit or harmful words.
  - The word “voice”.

- Some examples of names following our guidelines:
  - Anna - calm and kind
  - Robert - friendly grandpa
  - Steve - wise teacher
  - Harmony - soothing serenader
  - Jasper - jovial storyteller
  - Maya - confident narrator

**6. Scroll and accept terms:** Before sharing your voice model in the Voice Library, you’ll be asked to scroll and accept the [Voice Library Addendum](https://elevenlabs.io/terms#VLA) to our [Terms of Service](https://elevenlabs.io/terms) and provide additional consents and confirmations. Please do this carefully and ensure you fully understand our service before sharing. If you have any questions at this stage, you can reach out to us at legal@elevenlabs.io.

Before you share your voice to the Voice Library, we have a few guidelines that need to be followed. These guidelines are in place to ensure better discoverability and to maintain a clean and organized appearance for everyone using the platform. Please take the time to read through the guidelines below. They will help you understand how you should name, categorize, and tag your voice to enhance the overall experience for users.

### Review

Once you’ve created, named, and shared your voice, it will be set for pending review. This means that someone from the ElevenLabs team will go through your voice to ensure that it adheres to the guidelines outlined above. If there are significant issues, your request to share the voice model will be declined. If only small changes are required, the team might make these adjustments for you and approve the voice model for sharing.

As part of the review process, our team may add labels to your voice model to make it discoverable using the filters for the Voice Library:

- Gender
- Accent
- Language (the language of the source audio used to create your PVC)
- Age
- Use case
- Descriptive

Consistently uploading voices that do not adhere to the guidelines or are highly explicit in nature might result in being barred from uploading and sharing voices altogether. Therefore, please adhere to the guidelines.

Currently, we do not have an estimate of how long the review process will take, as it is highly dependent on the length of the queue.
