**Dubbing** allows you to translate content across 29 languages in seconds with voice translation, speaker detection, and audio dubbing.

Automated Dubbing or Video Translation is a process for translating and replacing the original audio of a video with a new language, while preserving the unique characteristics of the original speakers' voices.

We offer two different types of Dubbing: Automatic and Studio.

**Automatic Dubbing** is the default, so letâ€™s see the step by step for this type of dubbing.
