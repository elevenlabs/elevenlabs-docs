## Overview

Eleven Music offers an end-to-end workflow for music creation. Generate songs in any style, at your desired length,
and refine every detail with intuitive editing tools. Once complete, export your track as a high-fidelity MP3 audio file,
ready for professional use.

## Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new song">
    Describe your song using natural language prompts. Refer to our [Prompting
    Guide](/docs/best-practices/prompting/eleven-music) for best practices on style and lyrics.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select settings">
    Choose the number of **Variants** and the **Duration**. You can select a fixed length (e.g.,
    30s, 1m) or **Auto** for a dynamically determined length. For building complex songs, a workflow
    we've seen often is to start with a short duration like **30s** and iteratively adding new
    sections as you work on the song.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Make edits">
    Refine your track in the editor. You can edit lyrics, add or remove sections, adjust section
    durations, apply style keywords, or use direct conversational prompts for granular creative
    control. You can even generate completely new variations of the exact same prompt if you want a
    different track based on the same prompt in the same music project, or a different base to work
    from.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Download and share">
    Click the **Download** button to save your high-fidelity audio file, or use the **Share** button
    to generate a link with a customizable visualizer for your track.

  </Step>

</Steps>

## What can I generate with Eleven Music?

Eleven Music is a versatile model that gives you control over many aspects of music creation. You can generate:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Full Songs with Vocals">
    #### Full Songs with Vocals
    Create complete tracks with AI-generated lyrics and vocals in
    multiple languages including English, Spanish, German, and Japanese. The model understands
    nuanced prompts and can generate songs in most styles or genres.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Instrumental Tracks">
    #### Instrumental Tracks 
    Generate purely instrumental music across any genre, from cinematic
    scores to ambient lo-fi beats. Perfect for background music, film scores, or any project
    requiring instrumental accompaniment.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Specific Song Structures">
    #### Specific Song Structures
    Use sectional descriptions in your prompt to build songs piece by
    piece, defining the Intro, Verse, Chorus, Breakdown, and Outro. This gives you granular control
    over your song's composition and flow.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Music for Media">
    #### Music for Media 
    Design custom soundtracks for videos, advertisements, games, or other media

  <Accordion title="Genre-Specific Music">
    #### Genre-Specific Music 
    Generate highly specific styles by including detailed prompts, such as
    "Traditional Spanish flamenco with palmas, nylon guitar, and Spanish-language vocals" or "1980s
    synthwave with analog synthesizers and retro drum machines."

  </Accordion>

## Editing and Refinement

Once you've generated your initial track, Eleven Music provides powerful editing tools to refine every aspect
of your composition.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Adding and Removing Sections">
    #### Adding and Removing Sections

    **Adding a New Section:**
    - To insert a section between existing ones, hover over the section in the section view and click the
    **"+ Add Section"** icon that appears. This will add a section after the current section.
    - To add a section at the end of your track, scroll to the end of the timeline and click the **"+"** button.
    - Drag the new section in the timeline to adjust its duration.

    **Removing a Section:**
    - Hover over the section you wish to remove in the song structure view.
    - Click the delete icon (X) that appears in the corner of the section block.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Editing Lyrics and Prompts">
    #### Editing Lyrics and Prompts 
    To change the lyrics or instrumental prompts of any existing section: 
    - Click inside the text box for that section (e.g., Intro, Main Theme). 
    - Type your new lyrics or edit the existing prompt. 
    - Use bracketed descriptions like "[energetic guitar solo]" or "[drum fill]" for instrumental parts.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Style Control">
    #### Style Control 
    For advanced control over specific musical elements: 
    - Hover over the section you want to edit and click **"Edit styles of this section"**. 
    - In the "Section styles" window, you can: 
        - **Include styles:** Add specific musical characteristics like "gradual filter cutoff", 
        "hi-hats fade out", or "long delay feedback on vocals." 
        - **Exclude styles:** Prevent certain elements like "abrupt ending" or "new elements." 
    - Click **Save** to apply these style rules to that specific section.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Direct Prompting">
    #### Direct Prompting 
    Use the conversation interface at the bottom of the editor to make specific changes with natural language: 
    - Type direct instructions like "Make the chorus more energetic" or "Add a guitar solo after the second verse." 
    - This allows for creative editing beyond the structured tools.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regenerating Changes">
    #### Regenerating Changes
    After making any edits—whether adding, deleting, or modifying sections—your changes are staged but not yet applied to the audio.

    - Your edits will **not** take effect until you click the **Generate** button.
    - Once you click **Generate**, the model creates a new version of the song incorporating all your changes.
    - Feel free to experiment with different combinations of lyrics, styles, and structures between generations.

## Best Practices for Prompting

The key to great results is a descriptive and detailed prompt. The more information you provide, the closer the output will be to your vision.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific with Genre and Style">
    #### Be Specific with Genre and Style 
    Instead of generic terms like "rock music," try detailed descriptions: 
    - "Energetic 1980s synth-pop with a driving drum machine beat and male vocals" 
    - "Melancholic indie folk with fingerpicked acoustic guitar and ethereal female harmonies" 
    - "Heavy metal with palm-muted riffs, double bass drums, and aggressive vocals"

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Layer Multiple Descriptors">
    #### Layer Multiple Descriptors 
    Combine mood, instrumentation, tempo, and use case for better results: 
    - "A slow, melancholic piano melody over ambient synth textures, suitable for a tragic film scene" 
    - "Upbeat corporate jingle with bright synthesizers, punchy drums, and an optimistic melody" 
    - "Dark, atmospheric electronic track with deep bass, glitchy percussion, and haunting vocal samples"

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Define Instrumentation">
    #### Define Instrumentation 
    Call out specific instruments you want to hear: 
    - "Upbeat funk track with a prominent slap bass line, funky rhythm guitar, and a horn section" 
    - "Classical string quartet with violin, viola, and cello" 
    - "Jazz ensemble with piano, upright bass, brushed drums, and tenor saxophone"

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Include/Exclude Styles">
    #### Use Include/Exclude Styles 
    Refine your output by explicitly including or excluding certain elements at the track or section level: 
    - **Include:** "acoustic," "four-on-the-floor kick", "reverb-heavy vocals", "analog warmth" 
    - **Exclude:** "repetitive structure", "electronic elements", "abrupt ending", "distorted vocals"

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Build Section by Section">
    #### Build Section by Section 
    For maximum control, start with a short generation (e.g., 30 seconds for an Intro) 
    and build your song piece by piece. 
    1. Generate the **Intro** and refine until satisfied. 
    2. Click **"+ Add Section"** to add the next part. 
    3. Specify the style and content for the new section (e.g., Verse, Chorus, Bridge). 
    4. Use the conversation interface for specific instructions on each part. 
    5. Build your track progressively, ensuring each section flows naturally.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Iterate and Refine">
    #### Iterate and Refine 
    Don't start over if the first generation isn't perfect. Small changes can have a big impact. 
    - Adjust your prompt and regenerate specific sections. 
    - Use the editing tools to fine-tune individual parts. 
    - Experiment with different style combinations.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is music generation cost calculated?">
    The cost for generating music is calculated upfront based on your selected settings (like duration) 
    and is shown next to the Generate button. Unlike other ElevenLabs tools with fixed credit pricing, 
    the number of credits used can vary depending on your subscription plan. This is because the cost 
    is based on a fixed fiat price, which translates to a different number of credits for each plan.

    When using the **Auto** duration setting, the cost is fixed for that generation attempt, regardless
    of the final length of the song. This means a 2-minute song generated on "Auto" costs the same as a
    3-minute one, providing predictable upfront pricing.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long can my generated songs be?">
    You can create everything from short clips to full-length tracks. For maximum control, you can
    start with a short duration like **30s** to create an initial section, then iteratively use the
    **"+ Add Section"** button to build out your song piece by piece, extending it to your desired
    length.

    The minimum duration of a song is 10 seconds and the maximum is 5 minutes.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use generated music commercially?">
    Eleven Music is cleared for broad commercial use. See our [Music
    Terms](https://elevenlabs.io/music-terms) for specific usage details per subscription tier.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What languages are supported for vocals?">
    Eleven Music supports vocals in multiple languages including English, Spanish, German, and
    Japanese. The model can generate lyrics in these languages, or you can provide your own lyrics for
    the AI to sing.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I edit specific parts of my song after generation?">
   You can edit individual sections, modify lyrics, adjust durations, add or remove sections, and fine-tune 
    the style of specific parts. Changes take effect when you click **Generate** to create a new version.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get the best results?">
    The key is detailed, specific prompting. Include genre, mood, instrumentation, tempo, and use case in your 
    descriptions. Use the Include/Exclude styles feature for fine control, and build songs section by section for 
    maximum precision. See our [Prompting Guide](/docs/best-practices/prompting/eleven-music) for comprehensive tips.
