## Starting options

Some settings are automatically selected by default when you create a new project.

The default model is Multilingual v2, our highest quality model and the model we recommend for content creation. You can change this setting after you've created your project in **Project Settings**.

The quality setting is automatically selected depending on your subscription plan, and will not increase your credit usage.

For free, Starter and Creator subscriptions the quality will be 128 kbps MP3, or WAV generated from 128 kbps source.

For Pro, Scale, Business and Enterprise plans, the quality will be 16-bit, 44.1 kHz WAV, or 192 kbps MP3 (Ultra Lossless).

    You can add sound effects directly into your project by placing your cursor where you want the effect and clicking **Insert sound effect**. This inserts a new sound effect at that point, which you can reposition by dragging and dropping.

    Click the sound effect to open a pop-up where you can enter a prompt and set the duration. The maximum duration depends on the remaining length of the paragraph, up to 10 seconds. If you leave the duration set to **Auto**, the AI will determine the appropriate length.

    Click **Generate preview** to create four versions of the sound effect. Credit usage is as follows:
    - Auto: 200 credits
    - Manual: based on selected duration

    You can click **Regenerate** to generate new effects using the same prompt, or an edited prompt. Each regeneration uses credits.

    When you're happy with your sound effect, click **Apply** to finalize your choice. It will play alongside the narration unless you enable the **Blocking sound effect** toggle, which pauses the narration during playback. You can toggle this on or off for each sound effect.

    To delete a sound effect, press **Backspace**. You can undo the deletion with the **Undo** button unless the tab has been refreshed or the project has been exited.

    To duplicate a sound effect, you can copy and paste it.

  <Accordion title="Voices">
    ### Voices

    We offer many types of voices, including the curated Default Voices library; completely synthetic voices created using our Voice Design tool; and you can create your own collection of cloned voices using our two technologies: Instant Voice Cloning and Professional Voice Cloning. Browse through our voice library to find the perfect voice for your production.

    Not all voices are equal, and a lot depends on the source audio used to create that voice. Some voices will perform better than others, while some will be more stable than others. Additionally, certain voices will be more easily cloned by the AI than others, and some voices may work better with one model and one language compared to another. All of these factors are important to consider when selecting your voice.

  <Accordion title="Voice settings">
    ### Voice settings

    <Frame background="subtle">
      ![Studio voice settings](/assets/images/product-guides/studio/studio-voice-settings.webp)
    </Frame>

    Our users have found different workflows that work for them. The most common setting is stability around 50 and similarity near 75, with minimal changes thereafter. Of course, this all depends on the original voice and the style of performance you're aiming for.

    It's important to note that the AI is non-deterministic; setting the sliders to specific values won't guarantee the same results every time. Instead, the sliders function more as a range, determining how wide the randomization can be between each generation.

    If you have a paragraph or text selected, you can use the **Override settings** toggle to change the settings for just the current selection. If you change the settings for the voice without enabling this, then this will change the settings for this voice across the whole of your project. This will mean that you will need to regenerate any audio that you had previously generated using different settings. If you have any locked paragraphs that use this voice, you won't be able to change the settings unless you unlock them.

    #### Alias
    You can use this setting to give the voice an alias that applies only for this project. For example, if you're using a different voice for each character in your audiobook, you could use the character's name as the alias.

    #### Volume
    If you find the generated audio for the voice to be either too quiet or too loud, you can adjust the volume. The default value is 0.00, which means that the audio will be unchanged. The minimum value is -30dN and the maximum is +5dB.

    #### Speed
    The speed setting allows you to either speed up or slow down the speed of the generated speech. The default value is 1.0, which means that the speed is not adjusted. Values below 1.0 will slow the voice down, to a minimum of 0.7. Values above 1.0 will speed up the voice, to a maximum of 1.2. Extreme values may affect the quality of the generated speech.

    #### Stability

    The stability slider determines how stable the voice is and the randomness between each generation. Lowering this slider introduces a broader emotional range for the voice. This is influenced heavily by the original voice. Setting the slider too low may result in odd performances that are overly random and cause the character to speak too quickly. On the other hand, setting it too high can lead to a monotonous voice with limited emotion.

    For a more lively and dramatic performance, it is recommended to set the stability slider lower and generate a few times until you find a performance you like.

    On the other hand, if you want a more serious performance, even bordering on monotone at very high values, it is recommended to set the stability slider higher. Since it is more consistent and stable, you usually don't need to generate as many samples to achieve the desired result. Experiment to find what works best for you!

    #### Similarity

    The similarity slider dictates how closely the AI should adhere to the original voice when attempting to replicate it. If the original audio is of poor quality and the similarity slider is set too high, the AI may reproduce artifacts or background noise when trying to mimic the voice if those were present in the original recording.

    #### Style exaggeration

    With the introduction of the newer models, we also added a style exaggeration setting. This setting attempts to amplify the style of the original speaker. It does consume additional computational resources and might increase latency if set to anything other than 0. It's important to note that using this setting has shown to make the model slightly less stable, as it strives to emphasize and imitate the style of the original voice.

    In general, we recommend keeping this setting at 0 at all times.

    #### Speaker boost

    This setting boosts the similarity to the original speaker. However, using this setting requires a slightly higher computational load, which in turn increases latency. The differences introduced by this setting are generally rather subtle.

  <Accordion title="Pronunciation dictionaries">
    ### Pronunciation dictionaries

    Sometimes you may want to specify the pronunciation of certain words, such as character or brand names, or specify how acronyms should be read. Pronunciation dictionaries allow this functionality by enabling you to upload a lexicon or dictionary file that includes rules about how specified words should be pronounced, either using a phonetic alphabet (phoneme tags) or word substitutions (alias tags).

    <Note>
      Phoneme tags are only compatible with "Eleven Flash v2", "Eleven Turbo v2" and "Eleven English v1"
      [models](/docs/models).
    </Note>

    Whenever one of these words is encountered in a project, the AI will pronounce the word using the specified replacement. When checking for a replacement word in a pronunciation dictionary, the dictionary is checked from start to end and only the first replacement is used.

    You can add a pronunciation dictionary to your project from the General tab in Project settings.

    For more information on pronunciation dictionaries, please see our [prompting best practices guide](/docs/best-practices/prompting#pronunciation-dictionaries).

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Export settings">
    ### Export settings

    Within the **Export** tab under **Project settings** you can add additional metadata such as Title, Author, ISBN and a Description to your project. This information will automatically be added to the downloaded audio files. You can also access previous versions of your project, and enable volume normalization.

  </Accordion>

## Exporting

When you're happy with your chapter or project, you will need to use the **Export** button to generate a new version that you can download. If you've already generated audio for every paragraph in either your chapter or project, you won't be charged any additional credits to export. If there are any paragraphs that do need converting as part of the export process, you will see a notification of how many credits it will cost to export.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Export options">
    #### Export options 
    If your project only has one chapter, you will just see the option to export as either MP3 or WAV.

    If your project has multiple chapters, you will have the option to export each chapter individually, or export the full project. If you're exporting the full project, you can either export as a single file, or as a ZIP file containing individual files for each chapter. You can also choose whether to download as MP3 or WAV.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Quality setting">
    #### Quality setting
    The quality of the export depends on your subscription plan. For newly created projects, the quality will be:
    - Free, Starter and Creator: 128 kbps MP3, or WAV converted from 128 kbps source.
    - Pro, Scale, Business and Enterprise plans: 16-bit, 44.1 kHz WAV, or 192 kbps MP3 (Ultra Lossless).

    <Note>
      If you have an older project, you may have set the quality setting when you created the project, and this can't be changed. You can check the quality setting for your project in the Export menu by hovering over **Format**
