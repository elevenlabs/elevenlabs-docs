## Starting options

Some settings are automatically selected by default when you create a new project.

The default model is Multilingual v2, our highest quality model and the model we recommend for content creation. You can change this setting after you've created your project in **Project Settings**.

The quality setting is automatically selected depending on your subscription plan. For free, Starter and Creator subscriptions the quality will be High. For Pro, Scale, Business and Enterprise plans, the quality will be Ultra Lossless. The quality setting will not increase your credit usage.

## Generating Audio

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Export">
    <Frame background="subtle">
      ![Export your project](/assets/images/product-guides/studio/studio-export.webp)
    </Frame>
  Once you've added text, either by importing it or adding it yourself, you can use the **Export** button to generate audio for the entire chapter or project in one step. It will automatically generate and download an audio file, but you can still edit your project after this. Once you've finished editing, you will need to use the **Export** button again to generate and download a new version of your project that includes the updated audio.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Play">
  <Frame background="subtle">
    ![Play button](/assets/images/product-guides/studio/studio-play.webp)
  </Frame>
  You can use the **Play** button in the player at the bottom of the Studio interface to play audio that has already been generated, or generate audio if a paragraph has not yet been converted. 
  
  Generating audio will cost credits. If you have already generated audio, then the **Play** button will play the audio that has already generated and you won't be charged any credits. 
  
  There are two possible modes when using the **Play** button. **Until end** will play existing audio, or generate new audio for paragraphs that have not yet been generated, from the selected paragraph to the end of the current chapter. **Selection** will play or generate audio only for the selected paragraph. 
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Generate/Regenerate">
  The **Generate** button will generate audio if you have not yet generated audio for the selected text, or will generate new audio if you have already generated audio. This will cost credits. If you have made changes to the paragraph such as changing the text or the voice, then the paragraph will lose its converted status, and will need to be generated again. If the button says **Regenerate**, then this means that you're eligible for a free regeneration. You're eligible for two free regenerations provided you don't change the voice or the text.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Generation History">
    <Frame background="subtle">
      ![Generation History](/assets/images/product-guides/studio/studio-generation-history.webp)
    </Frame>
    If you click the **Generation history** button, this will show all the previously generated audio for the selected paragraph. This allows you to listen to and download each individual generation. If you prefer an earlier version of the paragraph, you can restore it, and it will then become the version that is used in your project. You can also remove generations, but be aware that if you remove a version, this is permanent and you can't restore it.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Undo and Redo">
  If you accidentally make a change, you can use the **Undo** button to restore the previous version, and the **Redo** button to restore the change. 
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Keyboard Shortcuts">
    <Frame background="subtle">
      ![Keyboard Shortcuts](/assets/images/product-guides/studio/studio-keyboard-shortcuts.webp)
    </Frame>
    There are a range of keyboard shortcuts that can be used in Studio to speed up your workflow. To see a list of all available keyboard shortcuts, click the **Project Options** button, then select keyboard shortcuts.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Multi selecting paragraphs">
    You can use Ctrl + Click (on PC) or Command + Click (on Mac) to select multiple paragraphs at once. This allows you to more easily assign voices to multiple paragraphs in one step.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Breaks">
    You can add a pause by using the **Insert break** button. This inserts a break tag. By default, this will be set to 1 second, but you can change the length of the break up to a maximum of 3 seconds. 

    Using too many breaks within a paragraph can cause stability issues. We are working on resolving this, but in the meantime, we recommend limiting the number of breaks in any single paragraph to around 2-3.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Lock Paragraph">
    <Frame background="subtle">
      ![Lock Paragraph](/assets/images/product-guides/studio/studio-locked-paragraph.webp)
    </Frame>
    Once you're happy with the performance of a paragraph, you can use the **Lock paragraph** button to prevent any further changes. Locked paragraphs are indicated by a lock icon to the left of the paragraph. If you want to unlock a paragraph, you can do this by clicking the **Lock paragraph** button again.

  <Accordion title="Voices">
    ### Voices

    We offer many types of voices, including the curated Default Voices library; completely synthetic voices created using our Voice Design tool; you can create your own collection of cloned voices using our two technologies: Instant Voice Cloning and Professional Voice Cloning. Browse through our voice library to find the perfect voice for your production.

    Not all voices are equal, and a lot depends on the source audio used to create that voice. Some voices will perform better than others, while some will be more stable than others. Additionally, certain voices will be more easily cloned by the AI than others, and some voices may work better with one model and one language compared to another. All of these factors are important to consider when selecting your voice.

    ### Voice settings

    <Frame background="subtle">
      ![Studio voice settings](/assets/images/product-guides/studio/studio-voice-settings.png)
    </Frame>

    Our users have found different workflows that work for them. The most common setting is stability around 50 and similarity near 75, with minimal changes thereafter. Of course, this all depends on the original voice and the style of performance you're aiming for.

    It's important to note that the AI is non-deterministic; setting the sliders to specific values won't guarantee the same results every time. Instead, the sliders function more as a range, determining how wide the randomization can be between each generation.

    If you have a paragraph or text selected, you can use the **Override settings** toggle to chnage the settings for just the current selection. If you change the settings for the voice without enabling Override settings, then this will change the settings for this voice across the whole of your project. This will mean that you will need to regenerate any audio that you had previously generated using different settings. If you have any paragraphs locked that use this voice, you won't be able to change the settings unless you unlock them.

    #### Alias
    You can use this setting to give the voice an alias that applies only for this project. For example, if you're using a different voice for each character in your audiobook, you could use the character's name as the alias.

    #### Volume
    If you find the generated audio for the voice to be either too quiet or too loud, you can adjust the volume. The default value is 0.00, which means that the audio will be unchanged. The minimum value is -30dN and the maximum is +5dB.

    #### Speed
    The speed setting allows you to either speed up or slow down the speed of the generated speech. The default value is 1.0, which means that the speed is not adjusted. Values below 1.0 will slow the voice down, to a minimum of 0.7. Values above 1.0 will speed up the voice, to a maximum of 1.2. Extreme values may affect the quality of the generated speech.

    #### Stability

    The stability slider determines how stable the voice is and the randomness between each generation. Lowering this slider introduces a broader emotional range for the voice. As mentioned before, this is also influenced heavily by the original voice. Setting the slider too low may result in odd performances that are overly random and cause the character to speak too quickly. On the other hand, setting it too high can lead to a monotonous voice with limited emotion.

    For a more lively and dramatic performance, it is recommended to set the stability slider lower and generate a few times until you find a performance you like.

    On the other hand, if you want a more serious performance, even bordering on monotone at very high values, it is recommended to set the stability slider higher. Since it is more consistent and stable, you usually don't need to generate as many samples to achieve the desired result. Experiment to find what works best for you!

    #### Similarity

    The similarity slider dictates how closely the AI should adhere to the original voice when attempting to replicate it. If the original audio is of poor quality and the similarity slider is set too high, the AI may reproduce artifacts or background noise when trying to mimic the voice if those were present in the original recording.

    #### Style exaggeration

    With the introduction of the newer models, we also added a style exaggeration setting. This setting attempts to amplify the style of the original speaker. It does consume additional computational resources and might increase latency if set to anything other than 0. It's important to note that using this setting has shown to make the model slightly less stable, as it strives to emphasize and imitate the style of the original voice.

    In general, we recommend keeping this setting at 0 at all times.

    #### Speaker boost

    This setting boosts the similarity to the original speaker. However, using this setting requires a slightly higher computational load, which in turn increases latency. The differences introduced by this setting are generally rather subtle.

  <Accordion title="Pronunciation dictionaries">
    ### Pronunciation dictionaries

    Sometimes you may want to specify the pronunciation of certain words, such as character or brand names, or specify how acronyms should be read. Pronunciation dictionaries allow this functionality by enabling you to upload a lexicon or dictionary file that includes rules about how specified words should be pronounced, either using a phonetic alphabet (phoneme tags) or word substitutions (alias tags).

    Whenever one of these words is encountered in a project, the AI will pronounce the word using the specified replacement. When checking for a replacement word in a pronunciation dictionary, the dictionary is checked from start to end and only the first replacement is used.

    You can add a pronunciation dictionary to your project from the General tab in Project settings.

    For more information on pronunciation dictionaries, please see our [prompting best practices guide](/docs/best-practices/prompting#pronunciation-dictionaries).

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Export Settings">
    ### Export Settings

    Within the **Export** tab under **Project settings** you can add additional metadata such as Title, Author, ISBN and a Description to your project. This information will automatically be added to the downloaded audio files. You can also access previous versions of your project, and enable volume normalization.

    </Frame>

    In Studio, provided you don't change the text, you can regenerate a selected paragraph or section of text twice for free.

    If free regenerations are available for the selected paragraph or text, you will see **Regenerate**. If you hover over the **Regenerate** button, the number of free regenerations remaining will be displayed.

    Once your free regenerations have been used, the button will display **Generate**, and you will be charged for subsequent generations.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Auto-regeneration for bulk conversions">
    When using **Export** to generate audio for a full chapter or project, auto-regeneration automatically checks the output for volume issues, voice similarity, and mispronunciations. If ElevenLabs detects any issues, the tool will automatically regenerate the audio up to twice, at no extra cost.

    This feature may increase the processing time but helps ensure higher quality output for your bulk conversions.
