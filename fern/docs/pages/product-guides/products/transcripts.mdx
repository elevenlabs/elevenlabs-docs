            2. The segments must be adjacent to each other

    <Step title="Re-assign segments to different speakers">
        There are 2 ways to assign segments to different speakers:

        1. **Individually**: click the orb next to the speaker name for a segment, and select a new speaker from the dropdown list.
        2. **Bulk:** to reassign all segments from one speaker to another, click on the three dots (⋮) and select 'Move Segments To'. Then select the new speaker.

        **Important note**: if you delete a speaker, all of their associated segments will also be deleted.
