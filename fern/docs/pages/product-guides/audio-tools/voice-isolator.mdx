To use the voice isolator app, navigate to [Voice Isolator](/app/voice-isolator) under the Audio Tools section. Here you can upload or drag and drop your audio file into the app, or record a new audio file with your device's microphone.

Click "Isolate voice" to start the process. The app will isolate the voice from the background noise and return a new audio file with the isolated voice. Once the process is complete, you can download the audio file or play it back in the app.

The voice isolator functionality is also available via the [API](/docs/api-reference/audio-isolation/audio-isolation) to easily integrate this functionality into your own applications.
