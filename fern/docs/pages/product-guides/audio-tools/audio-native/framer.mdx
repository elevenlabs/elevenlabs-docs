<Steps>
    <Step title="Add Audio Native script to your page">
        Navigate to your Framer page, sign in and go to your site settings. From the Audio Native embed code, extract the `<script>` tag and paste it in the "End of `<body>` tag" field.

        ```html title="Embed script "
            <script src="https://elevenlabs.io/player/audioNativeHelper.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
        ```

        <img
            src="/assets/images/product-guides/audio-native/audio-native-framer-1.webp"
            alt="Audio Native"
            className="w-full rounded-lg"
        />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add an Embed Element">
        On your Framer blog page, add an Embed Element from Utilities.

        <img
            src="/assets/images/product-guides/audio-native/audio-native-framer-2.webp"
            alt="Audio Native"
            className="w-full rounded-lg"
        />

        In the config for the Embed Element, switch the type to HTML and paste the `<div>` snippet from the Audio Native embed code into the HTML box.

        ```html title="Embed div"
            <div
                id="elevenlabs-audionative-widget"
                data-height="90"
                data-width="100%"
                data-frameborder="no"
                data-scrolling="no"
                data-publicuserid="public-user-id"
                data-playerurl="https://elevenlabs.io/player/index.html"
                data-projectid="project-id"
            >
                Loading the <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elevenlabs Text to Speech</a> AudioNative Player...
            </div>
        ```

        <img
            src="/assets/images/product-guides/audio-native/audio-native-framer-3.webp"
            alt="Audio Native"
            className="w-full rounded-lg"
        />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Publish your changes">
        Finally, publish your changes and navigate to the live version of your page. You should see a message to let you know that the Audio Native project is being created. After a few minutes the text in your blog will be converted to an audio article and the embedded audio player will appear.

            alt="Audio Native"
            className="w-full rounded-lg"
        />
    </Step>
