    <Step title="Add Audio Native script to your page">
        Navigate to your Framer page, sign in and go to your site settings. From the Audio Native embed code, extract the `<script>` tag and paste it in the "End of `<body>` tag" field.

            alt="Audio Native"
            className="w-full rounded-lg"
        />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add an Embed Element">
        On your Framer blog page, add an Embed Element from Utilities.

            alt="Audio Native"
            className="w-full rounded-lg"
        />

        In the config for the Embed Element, switch the type to HTML and paste the `<div>` snippet from the Audio Native embed code into the HTML box.

        <img
            src="/assets/images/product-guides/audio-native/audio-native-framer-3.webp"
            alt="Audio Native"
            className="w-full rounded-lg"
        />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Publish your changes">
        Finally, publish your changes and navigate to the live version of your page. You should see a message to let you know that the Audio Native project is being created. After a few minutes the text in your blog will be converted to an audio article and the embedded audio player will appear.

        />
