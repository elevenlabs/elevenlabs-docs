## Overview

ElevenLabs offers "data residency" through isolated environments in certain jurisdictions, allowing customers to limit data storage to those locations. As a standard, ElevenLabs' customer data is hosted/stored in the U.S., however ElevenLabs has released additional storage locations in the EU and India.

Depending on the customer's location, isolated environments in a particular region may also provide the benefit of reduced latency.

## Data residency in isolated environments

ElevenLabs offers data residency in certain jurisdictions to allow customers to choose where their data is stored. While storage will take place in the selected location, processing may nevertheless occur outside of the selected location, including by ElevenLabs' international affiliates and subprocessors, for support purposes, and for content moderation purposes. This detail is captured within ElevenLabs' Data Processing Agreement.

In certain locations, configurations may be available to limit processing to the selected residency location. For example, with respect to EU residency, users may restrict processing to the EU by using Zero Retention Mode and the API. In such case, content submitted to the Service will not be processed outside of the EU, provided the use of certain optional integrations (ex. Custom LLMs or post-call webhooks that require out-of-region processing) may result in processing outside of such jurisdiction.

## Existing core compliance features

Isolated environments complement ElevenLabs' existing suite of security and compliance measures designed to safeguard customer data:

**GDPR Compliance**: Our platform and practices are designed to align with applicable GDPR requirements, including measures designed to ensure lawful data processing, adherence to data subject rights, and the implementation of appropriate security measures as required by GDPR.

**SOC2 Certification**: ElevenLabs maintains SOC2 certification, demonstrating our commitment to high standards for security, availability and confidentiality.

**Zero Retention Mode (Optional)**: Customers can enable Zero Retention Mode, ensuring that sensitive content and data processed by our models are not retained on ElevenLabs servers. This is a powerful feature for minimizing data footprint.

**End-to-End Encryption**: Data transmitted to and from ElevenLabs models is protected by end-to-end encryption, securing it in transit.

**HIPAA Compliance**: For qualifying healthcare enterprises, ElevenLabs offers Business Associate Agreements (BAAs), which offer additional protections in relation to its HIPAA-Eligible Services.

## Developer considerations

Isolated environments are completely separate ElevenLabs workspaces, available via a different address on the web. As such, you will need to get access to this feature first to be able to sign in to an isolated environment with data residency.

### EU

- **Web**: https://eu.residency.elevenlabs.io
- **API**: `https://api.eu.residency.elevenlabs.io`
- **WebSockets**: `wss://api.eu.residency.elevenlabs.io`

### India

- **Web**: https://in.residency.elevenlabs.io
- **API**: `https://api.in.residency.elevenlabs.io`
- **WebSockets**: `wss://api.in.residency.elevenlabs.io`

Your account on the isolated environment will be separate to the one on elevenlabs.io, and your workspace will be blank. This means that when using an isolated environment via API, you will need to hit a different API URL with a different API key.

## Limitations

Currently, ElevenLabs provides limited support for migrating your resources from non-isolated to isolated environments. However, you can enable professional voice clone link sharing from a non-isolated environment and add it to your isolated environment; please refer to the FAQ below for instructions.
Reach out to us if you intend to move instant voice clones. For other resources, such as ConvAI agents, we recommend recreation via the API where possible.

Dubbing is not currently available in isolated environments.

### India

- India has limited availability for the LLMs used in ConvAI. Currently, only Gemini 1.5 Flash and Custom LLMs are available. Google will deprecate 1.5 Flash in September 2025, but we are looking for alternatives.
- Twilio doesn't currently offer an India routing region for its calls.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I run my isolated environment in parallel with the non-isolated one?">
    Yes, it is possible to do this and to bill the usage for both of them on the same invoice. For
    more details on unified billing across multiple workspaces, see [consolidated
    billing](/docs/product-guides/administration/consolidated-billing).
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does this relate to GDPR compliance?">
  For customers subject to GDPR, ElevenLabs provides options to limit storage and, in some cases,
  processing to the EU to support customers' compliance efforts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do isolated environments impact API performance?">
  For users inside the isolated environment region, data residency may potentially reduce latency
  due to localized processing. For users outside the isolated environment region, performance is
  expected to remain consistent with our global infrastructure. While there may be benefits as it
  relates to latency, the purpose of these data residency options are not specifically to improve
  latency.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is Zero Retention Mode automatically enabled in isolated environments?">
  No, Zero Retention Mode is an optional feature that can be enabled separately, even for accounts
  with data residency. It provides an additional layer of data minimization by preventing storage of
  content on our servers.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My API requests to the isolated environment are failing">
  Double check that you are using the correct API URL and the correct API key for the account on the
  isolated environment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I use an isolated environment in the SDK?">
  When you create the ElevenLabs client object, it takes an environment parameter which is by
  default US but you can set it to your desired environment.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I share a PVC from a non-isolated environment to an isolated environment?">
    To share a PVC with an isolated environment, first enable link sharing for that voice. Then copy
    the link, and add the prefix of the isolated environment to the voice link: From:
    `elevenlabs.io/...` â†’ To: `eu.residency.elevenlabs.io/...`
