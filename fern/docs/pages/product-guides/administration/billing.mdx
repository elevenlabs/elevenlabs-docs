When signing up, you will be automatically assigned to the free tier. To view your subscription, click on "My Account" in the bottom left corner and select ["Subscription"](https://elevenlabs.io/app/subscription). You can read more about the different plans [here](https://elevenlabs.io/pricing). At the bottom of the page, you will find a comparison table to understand the differences between the various plans.

We offer five public plans: Free, Starter, Creator, Pro, Scale, and Business. In addition, we also offer an Enterprise option that's specifically tailored to the unique needs and usage of large organizations.

You can see details of all our plans on the subscription page. This includes information about the total monthly credit quota, the number of custom voices you can have saved simultaneously, and the quality of audio produced.

Cloning is only available on the Starter tier and above. The free plan offers three custom voices that you can create using our [Voice Design tool](/docs/product-guides/voices/voice-design), or you can add voices from the [Voice Library](/docs/product-guides/voices/voice-library) if they are not limited to the paid tiers.

You can upgrade your subscription at any time, and any unused quota from your previous plan will roll over to the new one. As long as you don’t cancel or downgrade, unused credits at the end of the month will carry over to the next month, up to a maximum of two months’ worth of credits. For more information, please visit our Help Center articles:

From the [subscription page](/app/subscription), you can also downgrade your subscription at any point in time if you would like. When downgrading, it won't take effect until the current cycle ends, ensuring that you won't lose any of the monthly quota before your month is up.
