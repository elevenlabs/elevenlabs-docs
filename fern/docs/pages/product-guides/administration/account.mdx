To begin using ElevenLabs, you'll need to create an account. Follow these steps:

- **Sign Up**: Visit the [ElevenLabs website](https://elevenlabs.io/sign-up) and click on the 'Get started free' button. You can register using your email or through one of the OAuth providers.
- **Verify Email**: Check your email for a verification link from ElevenLabs. Click the link to verify your account.
- **Initial Setup**: After verification, you'll be directed to the Speech Synthesis page where you can start generating audio from text.

**Exercise**: Try out an example to get started or type something, select a voice and click generate!

You can sign up with traditional email and password or using popular OAuth providers like Google, Facebook, and GitHub.

If you choose to sign up with your email, you will be asked to verify your email address before you can start using the service. Once you have verified your email, you will be taken to the Speech Synthesis page, where you can immediately start using the service. Simply type anything into the box and press “generate” to convert the text into voiceover narration. Please note that each time you press “generate” anywhere on the website, it will deduct credits from your quota.

If you sign up using Google OAuth, your account will be intrinsically linked to your Google account, meaning you will not be able to change your email address, as it will always be linked to your Google email.
