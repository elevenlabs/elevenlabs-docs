## Overview

<Info>
  This is a new feature we are rolling out gradually to all our customers. If you don't see the
  share options yet and would like to get ahead, please reach out to success@elevenlabs.io.
</Info>

If your subscription plan includes multiple seats, you can share resources with your members. Currently, you can share:

- Voices
- Studio assets
- Conversational AI agents
- Dubbings
- Voiceover Studio assets

## Sharing

You can share a **resource** with a **principal**. A principal is one of the following:

- A user
- A user group
- A workspace API key

A resource can be shared with at most 100 principals.

Workspace API keys behave like individual users. They don't have access to anything in the workspace when they are created, but they can be added to resources by resource admins.

## Roles

When you share a resource with a principal, you can assign them a **role**. We support the following roles:

- **Viewer**: Viewers can discover the resource and its contents. They can also "use" the resource, e.g., generate TTS with a voice or listen to the audio of a studio instance.
- **Editor**: Everything a viewer can do, plus they can also edit the contents of the resource.
- **Admin**: Everything an editor can do, plus they can also delete the resource and manage sharing permissions.

When you create a resource, you have admin permissions on it. Other resource admins cannot remove your admin permissions on the resources you created.

<Warning>
  Workspace admins have admin permissions on all resources in the workspace. This can be removed
  from them only by removing their workspace admin role.
</Warning>
