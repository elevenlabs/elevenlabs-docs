## Overview

If your subscription plan allows for more than one user, you can share resources within your workspace with users, user groups, and workspace API keys. Currently, this is available for:
- Voices
- Studio
- Conversational AI agents
- Dubbing
- Voiceover Studio
- Audio Native

## Permissions

A **principal** (user, user group, API key) can have a **role** on a **resource**. We support the following roles:

- **Viewer**: Viewers can discover the resource and its contents. They can also "use" the resource, e.g., generate TTS with a voice or listen to the audio of a studio instance.
- **Editor**: Everything a viewer can do, plus they can also edit the contents of the resource.
- **Admin**: Everything an editor can do, plus they can also delete the resource and manage sharing permissions.

When you create a resource, as the owner of the resource, you have admin permissions on it, and this cannot be removed by other admins. Other resource admins will be able to remove anyone else from the resource, including other admins.

<Warning>
  Workspace admins have admin permissions on all resources in the workspace. This can be removed from them only by removing their workspace admin role.
</Warning>

When it comes to permissions, Workspace API keys act like an individual user. They don't have access to anything in the workspace by default, but they can be added to resources by resource admins.
