## Overview

If your subscription plan includes multiple seats, you can share resources with your members. Resources you
can share include: voices, conversational AI agents, studio projects and more. Check the
[Workspaces API](/docs/api-reference/workspace/share-workspace-resource) for an up-to-date list of resources you can share.

## Sharing

You can share a **resource** with a **principal**. A principal is one of the following:

- A user
- A user group
- A service account

A resource can be shared with at most 100 principals.

Service Accounts behave like individual users. They don't have access to anything in the Workspace when they are created, but they can be added to resources by resource admins.

#### Default Sharing

If you would like to share with specific principals for each new resource by default, this can be enabled in your personal settings page under **Default Sharing Preferences**.
Every new resource created after this is enabled will be automatically shared with the principals that you add here.

## Roles

When you share a resource with a principal, you can assign them a **role**. We support the following roles:

- **Viewer**: Viewers can discover the resource and its contents. They can also "use" the resource, e.g., generate TTS with a voice or listen to the audio of a studio instance.
- **Editor**: Everything a viewer can do, plus they can also edit the contents of the resource.
- **Admin**: Everything an editor can do, plus they can also delete the resource and manage sharing permissions.

When you create a resource, you have admin permissions on it. Other resource admins cannot remove your admin permissions on the resources you created.

<Warning>
  Workspace admins have admin permissions on all resources in the workspace. This can be removed
  from them only by removing their Workspace admin role.
</Warning>
