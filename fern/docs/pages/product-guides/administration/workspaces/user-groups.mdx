## Overview

<Info> Only workspace admins can create, edit, and delete user groups. </Info>

User groups allow you to manage permissions for multiple users at once.

## Creating a user group

You can create a user group from the workspace settings page. You can then [share resources](/docs/product-guides/administration/workspaces/sharing-resources) with the group directly.
Losing access to a user group also means losing access to resources shared with the group.

## Multiple groups

User groups cannot be nested, but you can add users to multiple groups. If a user is part of multiple groups, they will have the union of all the permissions of the groups they are part of.

For example, you can create a voice and grant the **Sales** and **Marketing** groups viewer and editor roles on the voice, respectively.
If a user is part of both groups, they will have editor permissions on the voice. Losing access to the **Marketing** group will downgrade the user's permissions to viewer.
