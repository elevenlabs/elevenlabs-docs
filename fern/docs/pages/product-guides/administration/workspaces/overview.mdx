## Overview

For teams that want to collaborate in ElevenLabs, we offer shared workspaces. Workspaces offer the folowing benefits:

- **Shared billing** - Rather than having each of your team members individually create & manage subscriptions, all of your team’s character usage and billing is centralized under one workspace.
- **Shared resources** - Within a workspace, your team can share: voices, studio instances, conversational AI agents, dubbings and more.
- **Access management** - Your workspace admin can easily add and remove team members.
- **API Key management** - You can issue and revoke unlimited API keys for your team.
