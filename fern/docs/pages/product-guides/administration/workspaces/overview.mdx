## Overview

For teams that want to collaborate in ElevenLabs, we offer shared workspaces. Workspaces offer the folowing benefits:

- **Shared billing** - Rather than having each of your team members individually create & manage subscriptions, all of your team’s character usage and billing is centralized under one workspace.
- **Shared resources** - Within a workspace, your team can share: voices, studio instances, conversational AI agents, dubbings and more.
- **Access management** - Your workspace admin can easily add and remove team members.
- **API Key management** - You can issue and revoke unlimited API keys for your team.

## FAQ

  <Accordion title="How do I create a workspace?">
    ### Creating a workspace

    Workspaces are automatically enabled on all accounts with Scale, Business and Enterprise subscriptions. On the Scale and Business plans, the account owner will be the workspace admin by default, and will have the power to add more team members as well as nominate others to be an admin. When setting up your Enterprise account, you’ll be asked to nominate a workspace admin.

    ### Managing the workspace owner

    Each workspace can have one owner. By default, this will be the account owner for Scale and Business subscriptions. Ownership can be transferred to another account.
    
    If you downgrade your subscription and exceed the available number of seats on your new plan, all users apart from the owner will be locked out. The admin can also lock users in advance of the downgrade.
