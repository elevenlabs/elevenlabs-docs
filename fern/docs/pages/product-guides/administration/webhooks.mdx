## Overview

Certain events within ElevenLabs can be configured to trigger webhooks, allowing external applications and systems to receive and process these events as they occur. Currently supported event types include:

| Event type                       | Description                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `post_call_transcription`        | A conversational AI call has finished and analysis is complete |
| `voice_removal_notice`           | A shared voice is scheduled to be removed                      |
| `voice_removal_notice_withdrawn` | A shared voice is no longer scheduled for removal              |
| `voice_removed`                  | A shared voice has been removed and is no longer useable       |

## Configuration

Webhooks can be created, disabled and deleted from the general settings page. For users within [Workspaces](/docs/product-guides/administration/workspaces/overview), only the workspace admins can configure the webhooks for the workspace.

</Frame>

After creation, the webhook can be selected to listen for events within product settings such as [Conversational AI](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/personalization/post-call-webhooks).

Webhooks can be disabled from the general settings page at any time. Webhooks that repeatedly fail are auto disabled if there are 10 or more consecutive failures and the last successful delivery was more than 7 days ago or has never been successfully delivered. Auto-disabled webhooks require re-enabling from the settings page. Webhooks can be deleted if not in use by any products.

## Integration

To integrate with webhooks, the listener should create an endpoint handler to receive the webhook event data POST requests. After validating the signature, the handler should quickly return HTTP 200 to indicate successful receipt of the webhook event, repeat failure to correctly return may result in the webhook becoming automatically disabled.
Each webhook event is dispatched only once, refer to the [API](/docs/api-reference/introduction) for methods to poll and get product specific data.
