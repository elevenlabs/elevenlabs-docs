If (i) the attempted notification is returned as undeliverable without a forwarding address; or (ii) if potential winner is otherwise unable to accept the prize as stated, the prize will be forfeited and may be awarded to an alternate winner. Only three alternate drawings will be held for each prize, after which the remaining prize(s) will not be awarded.
