## Pause

There are a few ways to add pauses to the generated text. One trick that seems to provide the most control and predictability is a simple dash (-) or the em-dash (—).

```
"It - is - getting late."
```

Ellipsis (...) also works to add a pause between words but usually also adds some "hesitation" or "nervousness" to the voice that might not always fit.

```
""I... yeah, I guess so...""
```

The system is always being improved upon, and ElevenLabs are currently working on adding features such as the ability to add pauses and change the speed of the generated voiceovers.

Alternatively, you can achieve a pause by inserting a line break or two where you want the pause to occur. The AI will often recognize the change in the text and adapt accordingly, resulting in a natural-sounding pause. With these techniques, you can customize your voiceovers even further and create highly polished content that meets your specific needs.

## Emotion

If you want the AI to express a specific emotion, the best approach is to write in a style similar to that of a book. To find good prompts to use, you can flip through some books and identify words and phrases that convey the desired emotion.

For instance, you can use dialogue tags to express emotions, such as “he said, confused”, or “he shouted angrily”. These types of prompts will help the AI understand the desired emotional tone and try to generate a voiceover that accurately reflects it. With this approach, you can create highly customized voiceovers that are perfect for a variety of applications.

```
"Are you sure about that?" he said, confused.
"Don’t test me!" he shouted angrily.
```

You will also have to somehow remove the prompt as the AI will do exactly what you give it. The AI can sometimes infer the intended emotion from the text's context, even without the use of tags.

```
"That's is funny!"
"You think so?"
```

This is not always perfect since you are relying on the AI discretion to understand if something is sarcastic, funny, or just plain from the context of the text.


## Pacing

Based on my own testing, which contradicts some information out there, I believe that when you use multiple samples in a clone, the AI puts them back-to-back without any space between them. This can lead to pacing issues and cause the AI to talk faster than it should. This is likely why some people have reported fast-talking clones.

To control the pacing of the speaker, you can use the same approach as in emotion, where you write in a style similar to that of a book. While it's not a perfect solution, it can help improve the pacing and ensure that the AI generates a voiceover at the right speed. With this technique, you can create high-quality voiceovers that are both customized and easy to listen to.
