Before adding Audio Native to Wix, you'll need to create & customize your player, whitelist your blog's domain, and copy your embed code. If you need help completing those steps, refer to our [Audio Native overview](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/audio-native/overview).

Now that you've created & customized your Audio Native player, navigate to your Wix blog, sign in, and open the blog post you wish to narrate in the editor.
Next, copy the contents of your article.
