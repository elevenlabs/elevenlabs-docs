Before adding Audio Native to Framer, you'll need to create & customize your player, whitelist your blog's domain, and copy your embed code. If you need help completing those steps, refer to our [Audio Native overview](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/audio-native/overview).

Now that you've created & customized your Audio Native player, navigate to Framer. Go to Site Settings in Extract the &lt;script&gt; tag from the ElevenLabs Embed Code and add it to your Framer Site Settings in the field: End of &lt;body&gt; tag.
