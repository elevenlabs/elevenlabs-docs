When using ElevenLabs API you have two options for selecting the server location:

## Using the closest servers (default)

Requests to `api.elevenlabs.io` are automatically routed to the closest available server location which minimizes network latency. We recommend using this option for most users.

## Manually specifying the server location

If needed, you can select a specific server location for your requests.

#### When using the client library

Provide the `environment` option when constructing the client:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import elevenlabs

client = elevenlabs.ElevenLabs(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    # Use the US servers only.
    environment=elevenlabs.ElevenLabsEnvironment.PRODUCTION_US
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { ElevenLabsClient, ElevenLabsEnvironment } from "elevenlabs";

const client = new ElevenLabsClient({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  // Use the US servers only.
  environment: ElevenLabsEnvironment.ProductionUs,
});
```

</CodeGroup>

#### When using direct API calls

Replace the `api.elevenlabs.io` hostname in your requests with one of the following values:

- `api.us.elevenlabs.io`: Uses servers located in the US.
